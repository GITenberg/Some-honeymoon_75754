<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE MAN OF BUSINESS
</h3>

<p>
When John Ryder put his foot upon the plank
of the <i>Minnequago</i> on his return journey from
Europe he was a bachelor of thirty-five summers&mdash;and
had never counted his winters at all.  He
believed, with many another upholder of single
blessedness, that a man did not begin to count his
wintry years until he was married.
</p>

<p>
Just the same, as he walked up the incline of
the runway he was walking to his fate.  Indeed,
he came face to face with it as he trod upon the
deck of the ship and, almost bumping into it,
politely lifted his hat and said:
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me!"
</p>

<p>
The lady bowed silently and turned upon him a
careless shoulder.  John Ryder allowed himself a
second glance&mdash;and then let the steward take his
hand luggage below while he did something he had
not done since his early crossings.  He hung about
on deck to see the hawsers cast off&mdash;a mark of
curiosity that usually stamps the traveler as quite
new to the game.
</p>

<p>
Even then he did not know why he did this.
</p>

<p>
Business.  Business with a big B.  Business first,
last, and all the time.  That was John Ryder, and
so plain was it to most people who met him that
a tag on his back stating that he was a hustling
American business man would have been quite
unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
Ryder had been in the chase after the nimble dollar
since he was breeched.  He was a self-made man,
and although he was proud of that fact he did not
go around blowing about the quality of the product.
</p>

<p>
People could take him for what he was&mdash;or what
they thought he was.  He was not personally assertive,
although he fully knew his own opinion upon
any subject to which he had given thought.  He did
not consider it necessary to tell every person who
interviewed him, or show them by his manner, that
he was really too busy with weighty affairs to give
their own little matter its proper attention.  He
seldom cared what people thought of him as long
as he impressed them with his honesty of purpose,
and that he was in earnest.
</p>

<p>
That is, he had seldom cared until now.  But he
confessed to himself, in the secrecy of his inner
thoughts and the privacy of his stateroom, that
he was desirous of having at least one person
aboard the <i>Minnequago</i> think of him as being
every whit as good as he really was, if not a little
better.
</p>

<p>
When a man's hard hit, that is about his first
thought.  He wants the woman to think of him as
the finest and best who has ever crossed her path.
And before bumping into Miss Mont as he boarded
the ship, he had actually never looked twice at a
woman.
</p>

<p>
She was a good sailor, and he had crossed back
and forth so many times that he was only seasick
when the Old Salt in the story was ill&mdash;on the
occasion "that the ship went down and all hands were
lost."
</p>

<p>
Ryder accepted his fate manfully on that very
first time that they paced the deck together.  It was
not easy for Ryder to admit that he had met and
fallen in love with a woman at first sight.  It was
opposed to all his well-established theories.  At his
age he considered himself case-proof.
</p>

<p>
Yet never had a woman impressed him as did
Miss Mont.  When they became so quickly such very
good friends and she showed plainly that she
enjoyed his society, and even took him into her
confidence with little urging on his part, Ryder
began to see that he would be tempting Providence
if he went ashore at New York without letting her
know just how he felt toward her.
</p>

<p>
He had nobody to consider in this matter but
himself; he had no family.  Miss Mont, she said,
was in a similar situation.
</p>

<p>
She had been adopted by people in Manchester
when she was a small child and had lived with them
as their daughter until these foster parents died.
</p>

<p>
Other children had come into the family after her
adoption, and they did not look kindly upon the
alien.  So Miss Mont had come away.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know much about my own people,"
she told Ryder.  "Only that my mother and father
are both dead.  There were several of us children.
We were parceled out like a brood of puppies.  I
know nothing now about my brothers and sisters."
</p>

<p>
So she had nobody to consider; there was no
living soul to say her nay, no matter what course
she took in life.  To John Ryder's disappointment
he found that she was on the verge of choosing a
profession for which he had a strongly rooted, if
narrow, dislike.  Miss Mont had met some
theatrical people in London.  There was, indeed, a
certain agent, or manager, aboard the <i>Minnequago</i> to
whom she had been introduced.
</p>

<p>
This man had told her that he could put her on
the stage.  She had the presence for it, and if her
ability proved anywhere equal&mdash;well, his talk had
inspired her with the fever for a stage career.  She had
done a little in a semi-professional way in London
as an entertainer, and this man, Sam Marks, had
chanced to see her work.
</p>

<p>
"And you know I need to work," she told John
Ryder.  "My bit of money won't last forever.  I
should dislike teaching, and I couldn't work in a
shop, I know.  I have a retentive memory, and I
believe I should 'make good' as you Americans say,
as an imitator.  I really have some talent."
</p>

<p>
"You do not know what you contemplate," cried
Ryder, and he was a little angry.  "The theater is
no place for a domestic, home-loving woman like
you."
</p>

<p>
"But it will bring me more money than other
work."
</p>

<p>
"It brings you a lot besides the money.  It spoils
a woman.  It spoils a man, too, for that matter.
And it is the hardest work a woman can tackle."
</p>

<p>
"Some actresses draw large salaries."
</p>

<p>
"And what do they pay for the pedestals they
gain?  You don't know the mire they have to drag
their skirts through.  And some of it always sticks."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are prejudiced," she said softly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know there are exceptions.  But there are
no exceptions when it comes to the hard work.
When an actress achieves a lasting place in her
profession, it means that she has worked harder
for years than any governess, or seamstress&mdash;yes, or
washwoman!"
</p>

<p>
"I know it is kind of you to advise me," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't.  It's selfish on my part.  I'll tell
you why.  I love you!" blurted out this man of
business, who was noted for his silky and diplomatic
tongue when it came to a business proposition.
This situation was, however, almost too much for
John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him in utter astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ryder!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be surprised," said he, mopping his brow
and glad the words were out at last.  "I'm no kid.
I've been bucking the world for a good many years,
if my head isn't bald!  I'm not likely to say a thing
I don't mean, or to try to fool a woman like you.
I love you, and I'll marry you the first minute we
can after getting ashore, if you'll agree.
</p>

<p>
"And I'm not doing it through any foolish desire
to keep you out of a business that you'll be
sorry you ever got into.  I want you for a strictly
selfish reason.  I want you because I love you&mdash;have
loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you
on this boat."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but we know so little of each other!" she
faltered.
</p>

<p>
"What more have you got to tell me?  It won't
take you long," said Ryder with a chuckle.  He
knew his drawing powers as an interviewer, and
could figure on Miss Mont's having told him about
everything of importance in her life.
</p>

<p>
"As for me, I'm plain John Ryder.  I'm just
what I appear to be, nothing more and nothing
less."  The sly villain, however, was hoping she
would think him a deal better than he was.  "I've
got some money.  I can make more.  I'll keep you
in comfort, and when I die leave you enough to
live on.
</p>

<p>
"That may not sound very sentimental, but don't
let it cloud your eyes to the fact that I love you
just as hard as any Romeo of the lot.  I'm not
much on playing the lute under a lady's window;
but I'll be great on hustling out and, as we
Americans say, 'bringing home the bacon.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, Mr. Ryder!  You make me laugh
in spite of myself."  But she was actually wiping
tears from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  I'd rather you'd take it laughing
than crying.  And as far as in me lies," he added,
solemnly, "I'll never bring tears to your eyes, but
always laughter to your heart," which was a
wonderfully pretty observation for John Ryder to make.
</p>

<p>
Nor was he at first disturbed in the least when
Miss Mont told him she dared not answer on such
short notice.  She must think it over.
</p>

<p>
"I like you," she admitted.  "I am fond of you,
I might say.  But to be bound to a man <i>for life</i>
upon so short an acquaintance seems an&mdash;an awful
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is rather sudden, I suppose," admitted
the American.  "Though I have often noticed that
the most successful deals I have ever put through
are settled in short order&mdash;on the spur of the
moment, as you might say.  Ahem!  This, of course, is
different," he added, seeing her smile.  "But take
your time.  Take until we land.  That's day after
tomorrow.  One can do a lot of thinking in that time."
</p>

<p>
And, from that moment, he religiously refrained
from recurring to the theme in conversation with
her, which showed plainly that John Ryder was a
novice at the game of winning a woman's love.
</p>

<p>
But before the <i>Minnequago</i> steamed safely
through the Narrows into New York Bay, Ryder
saw Marks, the theatrical agent, walking with Miss
Mont on the upper deck.  They were in close talk
for more than an hour.
</p>

<p>
He had never particularly noticed Marks before.
Now he found him a most objectionable looking
person&mdash;squatty, with bulbous arms and legs, and
his eyes half hidden behind heavily creased lids.
Ryder was stabbed by jealousy, and did not know
what the strange emotion meant.  He went to his
stateroom and wrote a note to Miss Mont.
</p>

<p>
It was a kind note, a just note.  It pointed out
the fact that he was still waiting for his answer, that
he could prove to her an hour after they landed
just who and what he was, and that he could do
all for her that he had said.  He added that he
desired her answer by the time the <i>Minnequago</i>
docked.
</p>

<p>
Strictly business, you see.  If he had been pulling
off a deal with another man and somebody like this
Sam Marks had put in an oar, this was about how
John Ryder would have handled the situation.  She
must choose at once between Marks and him&mdash;between
the position she would gain by wedding him,
and possible success upon the vaudeville stage.  Had
the ideas expressed in the note not been clothed
in the kindest terms and had not a strong current
of downright love permeated it, any woman might
have taken umbrage.
</p>

<p>
Ryder knew he had said nothing that could
offend.  Therefore, he was the more surprised
that no response to his letter was brought to him.
He remained away from the general table at dinner
that last night purposely.  He did not wish to meet
Miss Mont again until he knew exactly what her
answer was to be.
</p>

<p>
The evening passed without his receiving any
reply.  In the morning as they swung into the
dock at an early hour he asked the steward if there
was any message for him and received a negative
answer.
</p>

<p>
He had made his declaration and waited with his
repacked bag until most of the passengers, he was
certain, had gone ashore.  Until the last moment,
when he came to the gangway, he hoped to get
some reply from her.  Or was she waiting for him
to tell him verbally her answer?
</p>

<p>
She was!  There she stood upon the dock as he
went down the gangplank.  She was looking
eagerly toward the ship.  Ryder felt a sudden
tingling warmth at his heart.  His love for this
girl, so strangely born, made his pulse go at a
gallop and brought a flush into his sea-tanned
face.
</p>

<p>
She saw him, and the faint flicker of a dawning
smile overspread her sweet countenance.  He
approached with outstretched hand, his heart in his
eyes&mdash;an expression that no woman could mistake.
It told her&mdash;that look&mdash;as plainly as though
he cried it aloud: "I love you!"
</p>

<p>
The girl put out her hand&mdash;both her hands
indeed&mdash;impulsively and met his grasp with one quite
as warm.  Her eyes searched his face, perhaps with
a puzzled expression at first when he approached;
but afterward with decided approval.
</p>

<p>
"What have you to say to me, my dear?" asked
John Ryder, strong in his belief that she could have
only waited for him with good news.
</p>

<p>
A blush suffused her face.  Her lips parted&mdash;parted
in such a shy and lovely smile&mdash;as she said
in a low voice: "I&mdash;I will marry you."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he almost shouted, and immediately
added: "When?"
</p>

<p>
"Whenever you like," she whispered, and no
woman since the world began ever gave herself so
completely into her lover's keeping, John Ryder
was sure, as did this woman whom he loved.
</p>

<p>
"Then as soon as we can get the license and I
can arrange certain matters," he said quite
composedly, despite the accelerated beat of his pulse.
"We will drive first to the City Clerk's office.  There
is some red tape about the matter, I believe.  Then
I will take you to a hotel where you may lunch.
I shall need several hours for business before the
banks close.  Then we can go at once to a minister
of whom I know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! can it be done so quickly?" and she caught
her breath, though with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be frightened," he said tenderly.  "It
will be all right.  Where are your trunks?"
</p>

<p>
"On their way to the Pennsylvania Railway
station, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"So soon?  Were you getting ready to run away
from me?" he asked in some little surprise.
</p>

<p>
"No-o."  Then she laughed and tossed her head
with that gesture that had become familiar to
him&mdash;which he had noticed so many times aboard ship.
"I was getting ready to run away with you," she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
He laughed, tucked her hand under his arm, and
they walked up the dock.  Near the gate he saw
Marks standing.  Miss Mont did not chance to
look his way, but Ryder saw that the theatrical
man observed him and smiled sardonically as they
passed.
</p>

<p>
"Confound his impudence!" muttered Ryder.
</p>

<p>
Then he glanced at the woman at his side.  She
was certainly beautiful, with plenty of warm, rich
color in her cheeks, the blackest of level brows, the
very whitest of skin.
</p>

<p>
"By heaven! she's a treasure," thought Ryder,
as he hailed a taxicab.  "And I'm a lucky fellow to
get her.  To think that, in a few short hours, she
will be Mrs. John Ryder!"
</p>

<p>
A foolish little mist obscured his vision, and he
stumbled on the step as he followed her into the
cab.  She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You won't get married this year if you stumble
upstairs," she said.
</p>

CHAPTER II
<br><br>
"NEEDLES AND PINS"
</h3>

<p>
None of his business associates, not even his head
clerk, knew just when John Ryder would return to
New York.  He had gone across for a rest&mdash;a
pleasure trip; but he had struck some splendid
contracts&mdash;"the woods were full of them," he said&mdash;and
he cabled orders until his agents in America
fairly begged him to stop.  Prices for raw material
had not yet risen to top-notch, and they were
skimming the cream of the manufacturing situation.
</p>

<p>
He arrived on the <i>Minnequago</i> with none aware
of his coming.  Nor did he propose to tell anybody
of the change he now contemplated to make in his
private life.
</p>

<p>
Had he done so, he knew that certain "good fellows"
of his acquaintance would undertake to make
existence an agony for him and for this beautiful
girl whom he was to marry.  It seems to be the
delight of a certain order of mankind to make the
sweetest, most intimate hours of a newly-married
couple a Saturnalia upon which they can only look
back with horror.
</p>

<p>
Ryder was practically free to do as he pleased,
and what he pleased to do was to take time to get
acquainted with the charming woman at his side.
They must go somewhere for their honeymoon
where he would not be likely to run into people
he knew, and where he and his wife could be quiet
and undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
Getting the license was neither a long nor troublesome
matter, for they were the first at the clerk's
office.  He signed his name "John Ryder," knowing
that there were probably a dozen of the same name
in the directory and the publication of it would
scarcely warn his friends of what he was doing.
The girl signed after him, and surely nobody&mdash;unless
it was that detestable Sam Marks&mdash;would
realize who she was.
</p>

<p>
"Who will marry us?" she asked, leaving all the
details to him very prettily.
</p>

<p>
"We could be married right here in the chapel,"
he told her.  "But if you would rather, I know of
an old dominie on Bank Street."
</p>

<p>
"How funny!"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"That you should know anybody in that part of
New York.  That is Greenwich Village, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  You seem to have studied your map of
the town."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have learned a little something about
New York," she responded, smiling slightly.
</p>

<p>
Aside from this brief interchange of remarks,
there was very little said as the taxicab rolled
uptown to a quiet hotel.  Both were doing some very
serious thinking.  It was not a situation to provoke
trifling conversation.
</p>

<p>
Ryder arranged for a parlor where Miss Mont
could remain quietly during his absence.  He did
not delay for luncheon himself, but did not forget to
send up a dainty repast for his bride-to-be.  He
walked into the offices of John Ryder &amp; Company
about noon and cast the whole force into first a
state of confusion, and then of wonder.
</p>

<p>
He was usually the most methodical of persons
and went through with any business&mdash;even the
routine work of the day&mdash;in a most exemplary manner.
There was seldom any friction in John Ryder's
offices when he was there.  From his chief clerk
and his personal stenographer down through the
strata of employees to the very porter, system was
inculcated into their daily lives both by precept and
the example of the "boss."
</p>

<p>
Today he literally tore what little system there
was left in his force to shreds.  He started several
people on the same errand; he dictated the same
letter three times and in as many different ways.
His stenographer, a very severe young woman,
came closer to him than she ever had before in her
life and sniffed his breath.  Drink was the only
explanation she could think of.
</p>

<p>
He gave Brumby, his chief clerk, orders which
absolutely antagonized each other, and when the
man tremblingly pointed out this fact to Ryder the
latter actually lost his temper.
</p>

<p>
"Well, confound it!" ejaculated John Ryder,
"you know what I mean, don't you?  There's only
one sensible way to do that thing.  Do it, and don't
bother me!"
</p>

<p>
Inexplicable!  Nobody had ever seen Ryder in
such a state of mind before.  He was one minute
as snappy as a mud turtle; the next he ran his hand
through the curly red mop of hair on the errand
boy's head, gave him a dollar, and told him to take
in the next ball game at the Polo Grounds without
troubling himself to tell Brumby that his
grandmother had died.
</p>

<p>
But to capsheaf his entire performance on this
occasion, Ryder sat down again to dictate a few
notes on personal matters and began the first one by
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Ahem!  Are you ready, Miss Nelson?  Here
goes: 'My dear Rose'&mdash;Good Lord! that isn't it.
Er&mdash;er&mdash;Write Hallett and Mayes about the
renewal of the lease of my apartment.  Tell
them&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;  Well, write it yourself, Miss Nelson," he
concluded in much confusion and beginning to
perspire.  "I shall not renew it.  It runs out the
first of November and I shall make&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!&mdash;a
change."
</p>

<p>
She stared at him in amazement.  John Ryder
had occupied the same chambers on the north side
of Gramercy Park for ten years and was considered
as permanent a fixture in that neighborhood as the
fenced and locked garden in the middle of the
square.
</p>

<p>
"Well, hang it!" he demanded, catching her
wondering eye and losing patience again.  "Can't I
make a change?  I hope I'm not <i>married</i> to those
rooms?"
</p>

<p>
And then he reddened furiously.  Miss Nelson
gazed upon him with dawning understanding.  She
was not a young woman whose thoughts lingered
much upon the tender passion; but she was by no
means a fool.  She knew now that her employer
was not intoxicated.
</p>

<p>
Brumby might think Mr. Ryder suddenly bereft
of his senses; the bookkeeper could say that "the
old man" was about to "bust"; and the red-headed
office boy could declare that the boss had felt the
change before death when he gave up the dollar,
but Miss Nelson knew now what the matter was.
<i>Mr. Ryder was in love!</i>
</p>

<p>
When she went out for her lunch she&mdash;the frigid
Miss Nelson&mdash;sentimentally bought a flower from
a street vender and brought it back to the office.
But by that time John Ryder had cleared up all
the matters he considered really vital, had given
Brumby a nervous shock by telling him to expect
no word from him, Ryder, for at least a fortnight,
and had left the offices.
</p>

<p>
All these petty details of business were the
"needles and pins" of life.  For the first time in
his business career Ryder found that he hated
business.  He fairly walked on air as he hurried to the
subway, crowded himself into an already crowded
train, and was transported uptown.
</p>

<p>
A few steps to the hotel&mdash;then the elevator&mdash;then
the carpeted corridor to the door of the parlor
where he had left his bride.  A knock, a swift
patter of feet in answer, the turning of the key,
and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She was there&mdash;a vision of delight to him!  Her
coat and hat were already on.  His heart glowed.
She had been as eager for his return as he had
been to get back to her.
</p>

<p>
"Are&mdash;are you ready?" was all he could say.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she murmured, quite as embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
Ryder remembered the old parsonage on Bank
Street very well.  He had been wont to go to the
church hard by when he was a boy.  The same
minister was not there now, but the present incumbent
had a peaceful, old-world face, was silver-haired
and kindly spoken, and might have been the
same whom Ryder remembered.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman welcomed them as though he
were well used to such calls.
</p>

<p>
Miss Mont was shy and kept her veil down
until the clergyman's wife and a servant were
brought in to witness the ceremony.  Then she
plucked up courage, raised her veil, and if her
cheeks were tear-stained nobody remarked it.  The
old man stood before them and pronounced the
simply worded ritual with grace and kindliness.
</p>

<p>
Ryder himself felt confused.  It was really the
first time he had ever been present at such a
ceremony.
</p>

<p>
"With a ring?" the minister asked him softly
before he began, and Ryder knew just enough to nod
and then fumble in his inner pocket for a tiny
leather case which he always carried.
</p>

<p>
Out of this he brought forth, happily at the right
moment, a plain gold band, worn rather thin, and
with letters engraved on the inner side that were
almost indecipherable.  It had been his mother's
wedding ring&mdash;the one keepsake that had come into
his possession as a boy from the parent he scarcely
remembered.
</p>

<p>
The girl evidently understood when he produced
the ring.  She smiled at him tremulously and, before
the band was slipped on her finger, she touched her
lips to it.
</p>

<p>
Then: "You, John, do take this woman, Ruth&mdash;"
and so on to the end.  Ryder responded as though
in a dream.  It all seemed unreal.  Serious as was
the moment, the undercurrent of his thought was:
"'Ruth?'  That is a pretty name.  But I got the
idea somehow that her name was Rose."
</p>

<p>
They were married.  Ryder feed the minister with
a liberality that made his withered cheeks flush
with pleasure.  The clergyman's wife kissed Ruth
heartily, and the servant, who was sentimentally
inclined, wiped her eyes furtively on the corner of
her kitchen apron, which she had forgotten to take
off when she came into the study.
</p>

<p>
They went out to the taxicab again, the chauffeur
of which was grinning knowingly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, dear, where shall we drive?" asked John
Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"My trunks are at the Pennsylvania station by
this time I am sure.  May I choose where we shall
go?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he answered, though he felt some
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Then let it be Pinewood."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why," Ryder cried, "you must have
studied this business all out.  Ah, you sly girl!
What put Pinewood in your head?"
</p>

<p>
"They say it is very nice there&mdash;and quiet&mdash;at
this time of year.  It will remind us of old times,"
she added dreamily.
</p>

<p>
Afterward when he was attending to the checking
of her baggage and arranging for his own to be
sent on from the steamship dock, it suddenly smote
Ryder that her remark about Pinewood reminding
them "of old times" was peculiar.
</p>

<p>
This was Ruth's first visit to America and surely
he had never been at Pinewood in all his life!  Later
he forgot to speak about it.  Indeed, he was too
busy and too happy to be curious.
</p>

<p>
He telephoned ahead for a suite of rooms at the
only hotel which, he understood, was open at this
time of year at Pinewood.  This was the Pinewood
Inn, one of the oldest and best-known hotels on the
coast.
</p>

<p>
Somehow there is a "newness" sticking to bridal
couples that no amount of deception can hide&mdash;from
the eagle eye of the railroad porter least of
all!  The colored functionary on their car hovered
about them as though they had been especially
placed in his care, and his attentions were so
marked that they might as well have come aboard
showered with rice and old shoes.  Everybody in
the coach very soon knew that they were newly
wed.
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth, John Ryder was inordinately
proud of it.  He was as delighted as a boy.  It was
an effort for him to retain his usual dignified
bearing.  A smile was continually breaking through the
calm of his features.  He wanted to shout or
sing&mdash;and he sang like a crow!
</p>

<p>
From a heretofore modest and retiring man
socially he suddenly became bold and daring.  He
secretly wished to strut about and brag of
himself, and show off his wife.  He would have liked
to distribute "largess" (whatever that might be)
to the people at the stations where the train stopped;
and he tipped the porter three separate times before
the train was ten miles on its way.
</p>

<p>
He had reason, good reason, for being proud.
When Ruth removed her veil and hat she was
startlingly beautiful.  Somehow there had come a
new expression into her face that increased her
attractiveness.  She had never seemed so sweet,
so gentle and modest, so altogether adorable before.
</p>

<p>
They reached their railroad destination just as
dusk was falling.  Pinewood Inn was exclusive&mdash;so
exclusive, indeed, that it was back among the
pines quite twelve miles from the station.  A motor
bus met all trains and transferred the arriving
guests to the hotel.
</p>

<p>
"Just a pleasant half hour's run," Ryder told his
bride, helping her into the vehicle and getting in
himself with several other arrivals.  "We shall
have an appetite for dinner I fancy."
</p>

<p>
He was just then reminded that he had eaten
nothing since a modest breakfast in his stateroom
on the <i>Minnequago</i>&mdash;not even on the train.  The
bus rumbled away from the hamlet that surrounded
the railroad station.  They swept into the brown
shadows of the pines and rolled almost silently over
the velvet carpet of the needles.
</p>

<p>
"Needles and pins, needles and pins!  When a
man marries&mdash;&mdash;"  The old rhyme came into his
mind again.  But he had thrown off all petty
details.  The needles and pins of business, or of
anything else, should not rankle in his mind.  This was
the beginning of his honeymoon.
</p>

<p>
And just then the motor bus slid down a slight
slope to a long bridge that crossed the salt creek
dividing the island, which the railroad crossed,
from the higher ground where the hotel was
located.  Ryder, glancing ahead, thought he saw the
flash of a red light.
</p>

<p>
Then a woman screamed and the forward truck
of the motor bus crashed through the loosened
planking of the bridge.  The passengers were
tumbled together, but nobody was hurt.  Ryder
found himself holding Ruth in his arms&mdash;and
somehow he did not care to let her go.
</p>

<p>
Men and women began to scramble out of the
bus, having hastily gathered together what hand
baggage they had taken inside with them.  It was
a time of confusion.  A handbag was dropped,
calling forth a grunt of protest from someone whose
toes had been hurt.  An umbrella, caught crosswise
in the door, caused delay and more confusion.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I fancy we shall have to get out with the
rest of them," Ruth whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I suppose so," Ryder admitted.
</p>

<p>
They were the last to leave the stalled bus.  The
driver was explaining:
</p>

<p>
"I didn't suppose these country fools would begin
to repair the bridge flooring tonight.  I didn't see
the light.  'Twas all right when I came down from
the hotel.  Guess you'll hafter walk.  It'll take half
the night to jack this old car up out of the hole.
And see! they've left only a footpath the length of
the bridge.  I bet they'll leave it that way till over
Sunday.  Just like 'em."
</p>

<p>
The guests, already in sight of the hotel lights,
went on with laughter or grumbling, as their
dispositions dictated.  The incident seemed quite
unimportant to John Ryder, bemused as he was in the
very first quarter of his honeymoon.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
"WHEN A MAN MARRIES&mdash;&mdash;"
</h3>

<p>
Ryder and his bride climbed the winding road to
the wide and pillared veranda of the hotel behind
the other shipwrecked passengers from the motor
bus.  In the rear of the hotel was a considerable
village; they could see the twinkling lights in the
small frame dwellings and the glare of acetylene
lamps in the big general store.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I really think," Ruth observed, "that the
bridge is not safe.  Didn't it tremble as we came
over it?"
</p>

<p>
"Seemed rather a rickety affair, that's a fact,"
Ryder agreed.  "But we're all right now.  We've
reached the hotel.  It looks friendly and
comfortable&mdash;and old-fashioned.  Nothing much untoward
can happen to us here, dear."
</p>

<p>
He said it tenderly, and looked at her lovingly.
Nothing more was needed as they entered the
wide foyer to advertise the fact that they were
newly wed.  The clerk&mdash;and even the bellboys&mdash;welcomed
them with broad smiles.  But Ryder was
getting hardened to the notoriety of their situation
now.
</p>

<p>
He went to the desk to register and get the key
of the rooms he had ordered before leaving New
York, while Ruth went toward a quiet spot which
overlooked the entire foyer to wait for him.
</p>

<p>
His business finished, Ryder turned to look for
his bride.  He saw men standing or sitting about,
talking, smoking, and reading.  He saw women,
knitting or crocheting for the most part, in the foyer
and in the parlors, into which he hastily looked.
But where was Ruth?  Where could she have gone&mdash;and
why?  The bellboy waited at the elevator,
while Ryder stood helplessly, not knowing what to
do.
</p>

<p>
In a moment Ruth came from around a corner in
the hall, eyes shining and a smile on her face.
When she caught sight of Ryder, she went directly
to him, unheedful of all others, and a deeper
expression sprang into her happy eyes.
</p>

<p>
The man felt moved to the depth.  Could this
look be for him?
</p>

<p>
"I have been exploring a little," she said, as she
came up to him, "and this is a lovely place to stay.
I am glad we came here."  Then, dropping her
voice so that no chance passerby might hear, she
added: "Oh, I am happy&mdash;so happy&mdash;too happy,
almost!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder had the whimsical thought as he crossed
the foyer with his wife that he would like to shout
aloud his own happiness and exultation.
</p>

<p>
He hung back just a moment before entering the
elevator with Ruth, to give a bellboy some money
and certain instructions.  Then the couple were
shown to their rooms.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they are fine!  Lovely!" cried Ruth delightedly,
as soon as they were alone.  "You dear boy!
I believe you engaged the best suite in the house!"
</p>

<p>
"The best I could get," admitted Ryder modestly.
</p>

<p>
"But you mustn't be extravagant," and she came
close to him, smiling directly into his eyes with a
look in her own that almost dazzled him.
</p>

<p>
"Folks can afford to be extravagant at this
time if at no other," he declared stoutly, wondering
if she knew the Pinewood Inn people were
charging him thirty dollars a day for the suite.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you are a dear!" she said, and, putting
her hands suddenly on his shoulders, she pressed
closer, offering him her lips.
</p>

<p>
The gracefulness of this little gesture was
delightful.  Ryder felt the flush rise in his cheeks
as though he really were a youth.  In that instant,
when he first kissed his wife, he felt keen satisfaction
that he had lived a clean, decent life and could
meet her innocent caress without shame.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you are going to be a disgracefully
indulgent husband," she said, laughing and gliding
quickly out of his arms.  "I must stop that.  You
will make a wreck of your ship of fortune on the
rock of an expensive wife."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there are a few shots left in the locker yet,"
said Ryder grimly.
</p>

<p>
They could not dress for dinner as Ruth's trunks
had not yet arrived and his own luggage would not
be along until the next day.  Ruth had toilet
articles and brushes in her bag and she brought out
of this, too, a wonderful little dressing sack, all
ruffles and ribbons and lace, to wear while she
dressed her hair.
</p>

<p>
"May I smoke?" Ryder asked, sitting down to
wait for her.
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  I like to see you.  It&mdash;it seems so
homey," and she showed him a blushing face and
sparkling eyes for an instant at the curtained
doorway of the inner room.
</p>

<p>
She reappeared in the dressing sack, which was
cut to reveal most charmingly her throat and
forearms.  Ryder watched her lazily through the smoke
of his cigar while she performed the graceful rites
of the hairdresser.  He never remembered having
seen a woman brush and arrange her hair before,
and this intimate and innocent art of the toilet
thrilled him.
</p>

<p>
She had finished and turned to him with a smile
for his approval when there came a rap on the
door.  She tripped across the room and opened it.
</p>

<p>
"For Mrs. Ryder," mumbled the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I thought they were for me!" Ruth
exclaimed disappointedly.  "You have come to the
wrong suite, boy," and she closed the door
lingeringly.
</p>

<p>
Ryder sprang up, laughing.  "What was it?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, such lovely flowers!  A great heap of them."
</p>

<p>
Ryder strode to the door, still chuckling.
</p>

<p>
"She hasn't had it long enough to know her
new name," he thought, and opened the door to
call after the boy:
</p>

<p>
"All right!  Those flowers come here, sonny.
Let me have 'em."
</p>

<p>
He came back, bearing the heap of blossoms in
his arms.  "They're for you, girlie," he said.
</p>

<p>
She uttered a little scream of delight and came
at him like a small whirlwind.  But she could not
encircle both him and the roses in her embrace,
so she satisfied herself for the moment with the
flowers, sitting down in a low chair, with her face
buried in the fragrant blossoms, and rocking
herself to and fro in delight.
</p>

<p>
"You will spoil me!" she said, looking up at him,
as he stood above her with that broad, quiet smile
of his stealing over his big face.  John Ryder was
by no means a handsome man, but he was good to
look upon because of his manliness.  "These are so
beautiful!  Let us fill every vase in the suite."
</p>

<p>
This they did together.  And every time their
hands met (and, oh! how many times this happened
as they divided or arranged the flowers) they both
thrilled at the contact, looking at each other and
smiling and coloring like two children caught in
some innocent escapade.
</p>

<p>
It was a happy hour&mdash;an hour quite unmarred by
a thought or a suspicion of any possible disaster.
On his part Ryder had forgotten what trouble was
like.
</p>

<p>
The patronage of the hotel was large all the year
around, and at dinner they held the good-natured
attention of the entire dining-room.  There was a
good orchestra, attentive waiters, soft lights, the
murmur of conversation, fine women in fine
gowns&mdash;everything to make the place attractive.
Mrs. John Ryder in her plain traveling dress, however,
was eclipsed by none of the other women.
</p>

<p>
Ryder, watching her, saw many approving
glances from other diners, too, and smiled.  He
was thinking how she would shine&mdash;this jewel of
a woman he had married!&mdash;when she had time
to find some real "bridey" finery.  She looked like
a little brown thrush now; she would look like a
bird of paradise when he had given her <i>carte
blanche</i> at a Fifth Avenue modiste's.
</p>

<p>
He allowed her to go upstairs alone after dinner
while he strolled into the office for some cigars.
Several of the men he had seen at the tables were
grouped there talking earnestly, and as Ryder
stood at the cigar counter he overheard loud voices
from the private office of the manager at the rear
of the stand.
</p>

<p>
A man near by was saying: "I tell you the bridge
has sunk in the middle&mdash;it's impassable.  All that
held the wabbly old thing together were the flooring
planks.  This town is as far behind the times as
any yap hamlet I ever saw.  Why, we're actually
stuck here till they build a new bridge!  Can't get
a machine over it, or through the tide-water; and
the railroad bridges are nothing but skeletons, you
very well know."
</p>

<p>
"What about going over to Bearsburg&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing doing!  The roads behind this hotel
are the worst in the world.  The main road is
impassable for autos because of the work being
done on it.  It will be a good road some time next
spring.  As for the other highways, they are merely
lanes and farm paths."
</p>

<p>
"Guess you are marooned here, then, Carey,"
chuckled another.  "Might as well make up your
mind to it.  Come on!  let's see if we can't get up a
game and murder a little time."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door of the manager's office
opened and the clerk come out.  He had a worried
expression of countenance.  Now, hotel clerks are
supposed to be urbane at all times.  Flood or fire
should not alarm the well-trained hotel clerk.
</p>

<p>
Ryder looked quickly into the inner room.  He
saw the rather fleshy, white-waistcoated manager&mdash;a
man of evident choleric temper.  He was talking
loudly with a plainly dressed man who had a paper
in his hand, which he was evidently insisting that
the manager accept.
</p>

<p>
"You must accept this service, Mr. Bangs," the
smaller man interrupted, the manager stopping his
sputtering long enough to catch his breath.  "It
is not my fault, and personalities make no difference.
I am merely a court officer.  This is returnable
next Monday.  Shall I read you the original
paper?"
</p>

<p>
Bangs seized the paper offered him and swore
largely.  "You get out of here!" he roared.  "I'll
fix Giddings for this trick.  Dispossess me, will he?
I'll show him!  I'll&mdash;I'll ruin his old hotel for
him!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder walked away with his cigars.  Other people's
trouble did not stick in his mind now.  Broken
bridges and impassable roads did not disturb him in
the least; nor was he worried by the manager's
difficulties.  He had come here for at least two
peaceful, delightful weeks&mdash;and he was going to
get them.
</p>

<p>
When he entered his own rooms there had been
a transformation scene enacted.  Ruth's trunks had
arrived, and she had removed her traveling dress,
had slipped on the dressing sack again, and, to the
eyes of a mere man, she seemed burrowing in the
several trunks like a squirrel in a heap of fallen
leaves.
</p>

<p>
"Those poor porters," she explained, "had such
hard work getting these boxes over here.  The
wagon could only come to the bridge, you know,
and they told me they had to pole the luggage over
in a punt&mdash;-and that leaks and isn't safe.  Then
they brought the boxes on barrows to the hotel.
Re'lly!  They worked so hard that I gave them a
dime each."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  Ryder clapped a hand over his mouth, and
then sneezed to hide his laughter.  "Had&mdash;hadn't I
better stay out until this is all over?" he asked.  He
thought some of hunting up the porters and seeing
that they had larger tips.
</p>

<p>
"No.  You can remain if you will be good.  And
you can see my dresses, too.  I think I did very well
in getting them&mdash;especially when I wasn't <i>sure</i>, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Sure of what?" he asked, comfortably, establishing
himself in a reserved seat&mdash;that is, one that
was not already hidden under billows of feminine
wear.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sure I should marry you," she said, turning
to give him a roguish look.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes," murmured Ryder.  Then he
started.  "By the way, what chance did you have
to get ready&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His question was interrupted by a heavy summons
at the door.  He went himself this time.  One
of the bellboys was there.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, sir," said the boy in a low voice, "but
the manager, Mr. Bangs, has to tell you that the
hotel is to be vacated at once.  He had no notice
himself, so he can give you none."
</p>

<p>
"What in thunder do you mean?" demanded
Ryder, in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  You can't stay here, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  Does the manager want his money
in advance?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  'Tain't you alone.  Everybody's got
to get out, sir.  We're all losing our jobs, sir.
I&mdash;I don't know what to do myself, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's ridiculous!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know nothin' about it, sir.  I was just
told to tell everybody in this corridor.  And you've
all got to get right out.  He wouldn't let the clerk
telephone to the rooms 'cause it would take so much
time.  Mr. Bangs says he will turn off the lights at
half past eight and lock the door&mdash;that's in half
an hour, sir.  There's to be no service after that
time."
</p>

<p>
The boy hurried to the door of the next suite.
Ryder was too amazed at first to feel proper anger.
To be told that, in half an hour, one must get out
of a hotel in which one has just established
oneself&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is preposterous!" determined John Ryder,
turning back into his rooms.  He saw Ruth, all
unconscious of the unpleasant announcement, still
busy over the trunks.  The uselessness of her task
suddenly smote his mind.  "Why," he muttered,
"she's wasting her time.  She might as well stop
that if we can't stay here.  And, by thunder! where
will we go if this hotel closes&mdash;and at such an
hour?
</p>

<p>
"There's not another hotel open in Pinewood, I
understand.  The bridge is down.  That fellow
says traffic to the west is barred by the condition
of the roads.  The dickens!"
</p>

<p>
Ruth had paid no attention to his mutterings.
She was quite unconscious of his perplexity, or of
its cause.  He came to a quick decision.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going downstairs a moment, dear," he said.
</p>

<p>
"All right."
</p>

<p>
"All right, what?  Haven't you a name for me?"
he inquired, drawing her to him.
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;hubby," she replied, blushing slightly,
and he kissed her and then shot out of the room
and dashed down the single flight of stairs to join
the excited crowd already milling about the hotel
desk.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
"HIS TROUBLE BEGINS!"
</h3>

<p>
Bangs, the red-faced manager of Pinewood
Inn, was facing the group of clamoring masculine
guests like a rat at bay before a pack of terriers.
Every individual man in the crowd was demanding
what it meant.
</p>

<p>
Then, before he could make any audible explanation,
they burst out again in a staccato of such
observations as:
</p>

<p>
"It's an outrage!  The man should be hung!"
</p>

<p>
"I never heard the like!  Why, my wife says&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's a most abominable imposition!  Lights out
at half past eight!"
</p>

<p>
"And the help discharged!"
</p>

<p>
"And no other hotel open anywhere along this
part of the coast!  Disgraceful!"
</p>

<p>
"Not even a cottage open.  We can't go and
live on these muckers who stay here all winter."
</p>

<p>
Then a general roar, as they faced Bangs again:
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by it?"
</p>

<p>
"If you'll give me a chance to tell you!" shouted
Bangs, shaking both clenched fists in the air.  "And
if you'll listen to reason perhaps I can make you
understand."
</p>

<p>
Then, as a grumbling silence was accorded him,
he added: "At last I can make myself heard!
Lemme tell you about it.  Giddings, the trustee of
the Barnaby estate, the owners of this hotel, and I
have had some difficulty over the rental.  And
because I won't agree to be robbed by him, he has
taken this tack&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What tack?" asked John Ryder, thrusting in a
question which struck at the heart of the business.
"You haven't said what he has done."
</p>

<p>
"He's served me with dispossess papers," said
the heated Bangs.
</p>

<p>
"Then you haven't paid your rent," Ryder
observed.  "Why don't you pay it and not put your
guests to this trouble?  Settle with Giddings in the
courts."
</p>

<p>
"He'd beat me&mdash;the scoundrel!" cried Bangs.
"And the rent is exorbitant.  I served him notice
three months ago that I could not run this hotel
and pay such a price for it.  It's an imposition."
</p>

<p>
"It is a greater imposition on your part to give
your guests half an hour's notice to get out.  Why,
Bangs, it really can't be done, you know," said
one man.
</p>

<p>
But John Ryder, with his clear insight into anything
of this kind, again drove right at the heart of
the business.
</p>

<p>
"You have had three months to prepare for this
very emergency," he said.  "You admit that."
</p>

<p>
"I don't!" yelled Bangs.  "I admit nothing of the
kind.  They just served me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then you have several days in which to arrange
the matter," Ryder went on.  "What about this
turning off the lights in half an hour?  It is
ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what it is," chimed in another
aggrieved voice.  "You can't put your guests out
in any such way, Mr. Bangs&mdash;and guests who,
some of them, have been here long before you
were ever manager.  My wife and I have been
staying here for eight years.  I can't be turned out
of my home on half an hour's notice."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'd have to get out if there was a
fire," snarled Bangs.
</p>

<p>
"A fire would be 'an act of God,' according to the
coroner's finding," grimly laughed somebody.
"This isn't."
</p>

<p>
"Quite the contrary.  It's a deucedly mean
trick."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't my fault, I tell you," Bangs mendaciously
declared.  "You can blame that hound, Giddings.
I can't be bled any more of all my profits, and I
am going to close my connection with this hotel
tonight&mdash;and in a very few minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens, Bangs!" exclaimed one man.
"Get out if you want to.  We'll none of us weep
over your departure.  Leave George, here, to run
the desk and Al, the steward, to see to the kitchen
and the help, and we'll get along all right."
</p>

<p>
"And who is going to assure the help's wages?"
demanded Bangs.  "<i>I'm</i> not, you bet!  And who'll
pay for the lighting and heating?  I can tell you
gentlemen right now there isn't coal enough in the
bins to run the dynamos and boilers till midnight."
</p>

<p>
At that a howl went up which boded ill for the
manager of the Pinewood Inn and he dodged behind
the desk before which he had been standing.
Several of his guests looked suddenly dangerous to
Bangs.
</p>

<p>
There came, however, an interruption.  Somebody
said: "Here comes Colonel Brack," and the
group parted willingly enough to let in a tall,
military figure of a man with drooping gray
mustache and goatee, fiery eyes under penthouse
brows&mdash;a man who walked with the "step-clump,
step-clump" of a cripple with an artificial limb.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Colonel Brack bore himself very
erect and stepped with a firmness that betrayed more
than ordinary hardihood of character.  The other
guests who knew him looked upon the old man with
evident respect.
</p>

<p>
"What is this I hear, Bangs?" the ex-military
officer demanded in a deep voice.  "You sent one
of your cubs to my room with a saucy message and
I boxed his ears for him.  What do you mean by
telling me to get out of this hotel, suh?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't help it, Colonel Brack," declared the
manager, backing out of any possible reach of the
colonel's long arm.  "The hotel's got to close."
</p>

<p>
"Then close it.  But do it decently and in order,"
the colonel said.  "Still, I doubt if the Barnaby
estate will allow the house to be shut.  They can
find somebody else to run it quite as well as you,
suh."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they won't find that other man tonight!"
cried Bangs, in a tone that showed he felt impish
delight in making all this trouble.  "And I am
going to close the house now.  I've said my last
word, gentlemen.  If you want to pack your trunks,
I'll keep the dynamos running till nine o'clock.
There is a combination train leaves here&mdash;over the
spur track, you understand, at that hour&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Confound you!  Yes!" cried somebody.  "But
it only goes as far as the Junction and there is no
connection there for New York until five o'clock
in the morning.  A nice train for ladies to take!"
</p>

<p>
"And how about those of us who have our autos
here?" chimed in another.  "The bridge is down.
Your own motor bus is out of commission.  The
other roads are impassable for cars.  You ought
to be beaten to death, Bangs!"
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es&mdash;" drawled a sleek, dapper little man,
whom, so Ryder told himself, one would naturally
expect to speak in a crisp, quick tone, quite contrary
to the one he used.  "Ye-es, suppose we do tha-at
same thing.  It would not do the gu-uests of this
hotel much good just now, perhaps; but it would
rid the wo-orld of one rascal.  Tha-at would be to
the good."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Brack leaned over the counter and shook
a long finger at the manager.
</p>

<p>
"I have lived in this hotel fourteen years, sub!"
he exclaimed.  "No manager can dispossess me.
I refuse to get out, suh&mdash;I refuse to get out!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-050"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-050.jpg" alt="&quot;No manager can dispossess me. I refuse to get out&quot;">
<br>
&quot;No manager can dispossess me. I refuse to get out&quot;
</p>

<p>
"That's right!  We all refuse to get out!" was
the vociferous chorus.
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll stay in the dark and without heat
and without service," growled Bangs doggedly.
"I'm doing my best for you.  I'll be liable for no
further expense in a house of which I am
dispossessed&mdash;that's flat!"
</p>

<p>
Bangs here erased himself from the scene by
dodging into the private office and banging the
door.  The clerk oh duty was instantly besieged by
a part of the crowd.  He could do absolutely nothing
to assist in untangling the difficulty.  Like the
other hotel employees, he was as much disturbed
over his abrupt discharge as the guests were over
their dismissal by the manager.
</p>

<p>
"I shall remain here, even if that rascal shuts
off the heat and lights," Colonel Brack loudly
declared, in the midst of the group of which John
Ryder was one.  "It is a preposterous&mdash;an impossible
situation, suh!  Whoever heard the like?  A
hotel cannot close its doors and turn its guests out
upon the streets on half an hour's notice."
</p>

<p>
"But Bangs will do as he says.  I know the dog.
When he's ugly, he'll do anything," returned one
man gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"He may turn off the heat and light; but here
I stay!" reiterated the colonel, with all the
determination of Horatius on the Bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Not a pleasant prospect," said a drummer.  "I
reckon I'll go and pack up and take that nine o'clock
switchback."
</p>

<p>
"We cannot all do that," Ryder finally said, with
calmness.  "It is ridiculous to think of the ladies
leaving on such short notice&mdash;especially those who
have lived here for any length of time."
</p>

<p>
"And there's one car on that train, a combination
day coach and smoker.  It wouldn't hold a
third of the guests in this house to-night," was the
positive declaration of another man.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," Ryder pursued, "how would we get
our baggage away at this hour?  If we left it,
thieves would ransack every trunk in the house.
This Bangs is evidently a slippery customer.  He
could not be found, it is likely, when it came time to
apportion damages."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, suh," said Colonel Brack.  "You
are Mr. John Ryder, of New York?"
</p>

<p>
Ryder acknowledged it.  "My wife and I have
just arrived, intending to remain a fortnight or so.
I don't fancy having our visit spoiled in this way."
</p>

<p>
"Then, Mr. Ryder," said the colonel pompously,
"I wish you would come into the café with a
number of us older guests, suh, where we will hold a
council of war."  The colonel could scarcely
conceive of any discussion being official out of sight
of a bar.  "We cannot be driven out of this hotel
in this way.  We must plan some means of thwarting
Bangs, suh."
</p>

<p>
"We'd better chip in and pay his rent for him,"
suggested one compromising individual, bent on
cutting the Gordian knot with one simple stroke.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said the colonel hastily, "that
he is at least three months behind in his rent.  That
would never do.  And it is not because he is
unable to pay.  The house is well patronized and
he collects his money promptly.  It is merely a
personal fight between him and Giddings, who, I
judge, desires to break this fellow's connection with
Pinewood Inn.  I never did like the dog."
</p>

<p>
"Giddings should come down here and attend to
the matter himself, then," said another of the angry
guests.
</p>

<p>
"I do not presume for a moment," said the
colonel, starting for the barroom, "that Giddings
dreamed Bangs would do this.  No, suh!  No
gentleman could imagine such a dastardly thing."
</p>

<p>
"But it seems to have been in the manager's
mind for some time," Ryder interposed.  "He has
allowed his coal to run so low that there is not
enough, he now says, to last the night through."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he is lying," Jimson suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No," asserted some one.  "He's not lying now,
for once in his life.  He's telling the truth this
time&mdash;but only because the truth is meaner than any
lie he could possibly concoct."
</p>

<p>
"He has planned to get back at Giddings and
the estate by injuring the reputation of the hotel.
Why, gentlemen," pursued the wrathful colonel, all
bristling like an enraged turkeycock, "this house has
been my home for fourteen years.  I am the oldest
inhabitant.  Mr. Jimson, here, has an invalid wife.
She cannot be taken out at this hour of the night.
And the house has been her home for eight years.
It is brutal&mdash;positively brutal!"
</p>

<p>
"All right!  All right!" said Ryder.  "But this
isn't getting us anywhere.  We all know our
wrongs.  Let's see what can be done to stop the
fellow's deviltry."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" exclaimed a man at his elbow.  "Here
Bangs is turning us out and along come other guests.
What do you know about that?"
</p>

<p>
"How could anyone get here at this hour with
that bridge in that condition?" queried Jimson.
"Couldn't get an auto over it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anyone that was eager enough to come
could get punted over the inlet.  Must have come
down on that train that does not stop at Barr,
though, and motored back from the first stop
below&mdash;unless a big enough party was on to make a
special stop possible."
</p>

<p>
But it was a single guest only who entered the
foyer and office of the hotel.  This man had no
luggage and he stood for a moment nervously drawing
off his gloves as his glance swept swiftly the
faces of those in sight.
</p>

<p>
George, the clerk, stepped to the turntable on
which the register rested.  It was not a grateful
task to inform the man who had just come what
the situation of affairs was.
</p>

<p>
Ryder noticed the stranger only casually at first.
The group of excited men, whom he was tailing
toward the café, were slow in leaving the vicinity
of the hotel desk.
</p>

<p>
When the clerk had explained the situation as
well as he was able the disappointed guest stood
back, nervously rolling his gloves and with an
expression of indetermination upon his face.  Finally
he asked George a question in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  Nobody by that name in the house,
sir," the clerk said.
</p>

<p>
One of the boys came through the foyer intoning
the name of a guest: "Mr. White's wanted.
Mr. White!  Mr. White!"
</p>

<p>
Nobody gave the boy any attention at first, and
he approached the desk still singsonging the name
of the man wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Who's wanted?" asked George, the clerk,
briskly.
</p>

<p>
"Message for Mr. White.  His wife wants him
upstairs&mdash;Suite Three."
</p>

<p>
"White?" repeated the clerk.  "What White's
that?  I didn't know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Just then Ryder, looking back over his shoulder,
chanced to see again the face of the last comer
to the hotel.  He was as pale as death; Ryder could
see the drops of perspiration standing on his broad,
high brow.  He was staring at the bellboy as though
in the latter he beheld a ghost.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, while the puzzled clerk bent over the
register evidently in search of the name "White"
among those of the new arrivals at Pinewood Inn,
the stranger darted at the bellboy.  "Who&mdash;who is
asking for Mr. White?" Ryder heard the man
gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. White.  She wants him.  Suite Three,"
repeated the boy.  "Mr. John B. White."
</p>

<p>
The emotions displayed in succession upon the
stranger's countenance ran the gamut of human
expression.  Amazement, incredulity, rage,
determination&mdash;a dozen different feelings evidently
gripped the man's mind and soul.  Ryder had his
own attention recalled with difficulty by Colonel
Brack, who stuck his head out of the swinging door
of the café, crying:
</p>

<p>
"We're waiting for you, suh!  Mr. Ryder, what'll
you take, suh?  And I'd like your opinion on this
important matter.  It will cost us, severally and
collectively, some money to keep this house open.
I, for one, will assume my share of the obligation
and trust to getting back at Bangs afterward.  What
do you say, Mr. Ryder?"
</p>

<p>
The discussion of ways and means claimed the
attention of John Ryder.  Yet he glanced back at
the stranger again as he entered the café.  The
latter was moving toward the stairway clutching
the bellboy firmly by the shoulder.  Back in
the mind of Ryder was this comment:
</p>

<p>
"Odd about that fellow.  Acts strange.  White?
Don't know anyone of the name&mdash;that I remember.
Suite Three?  Why&mdash;what's the number of our
suite?  I thought that was Number Three.  Must
be Number Two.  Odd&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE ARROW OF SUSPICION
</h3>

<p>
The first excitement having worn away, the
Council of War was now organized.  Colonel Brack
had gathered together those men best fitted to form
a working committee&mdash;and likewise best able to
finance any scheme decided upon for the keeping
open of Pinewood Inn.
</p>

<p>
The situation was already thoroughly canvassed.
No other hotel in the vicinity was open.  To escape
from the place by either motor or train&mdash;at least
for some hours, if not days&mdash;was impossible.  Local
residents could not take in the hotel guests had
they so desired.  Here were women and children
used to every luxury who were threatened with
dismissal from the hotel at once.  As the colonel
loudly said, it was brutal.
</p>

<p>
The track to Pinewood was for the accommodation
of freight for the most part.  For the very
reason that the owners of the Barnaby property
wished to keep the hotel exclusive, they had fought
any improvement in railroad accommodations.
</p>

<p>
At this time of night even the station telegraph
office was closed; and George had already informed
the guests that there had been a break in the
long-distance telephone service since dark.
</p>

<p>
Any such thing as a special train to transport
the guests to New York could not be arranged for
until the following day.
</p>

<p>
"And we'd have to put up with vile accommodations
from here to the Junction," explained the
excitable Jimson.  "Do you realize that this spur-track
roadbed is scarcely fit to pull coal cars over?
My wife couldn't stand it, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"How about getting across to the island and to
the regular railroad station at Barr?" John Ryder
asked.
</p>

<p>
"That bridge is practically a wreck.  Do you
know the bus slumped clear through it, and will
have to be raised by a derrick?  And the road to
any other station is impossible for autos.  No, we
can't get away and that's all there is to it."
</p>

<p>
This was the consensus of opinion.  The
disorganization of the hotel employees which would
follow the closing of the doors of the house and its
abandonment by the guests would make it unsafe
to leave personal property in the hotel.  There were
half a hundred reasons, and all very good ones,
that proved the guests must remain.
</p>

<p>
"And in union there is strength," quoted Mr. Jimson.
</p>

<p>
"We must hang together," declared another.
</p>

<p>
"Speaking of hanging," observed one, "how
would it do to begin with Bangs?  I'd like to see
him dangling at the end of a rope."
</p>

<p>
"Better starve him," murmured another.
</p>

<p>
But these futile remarks were cut off when John
Ryder began to speak seriously.  He suggested
that a committee be appointed to confer in a quiet
way with Bangs and try to pacify him if possible&mdash;even
if it cost some money.  Some arrangement
should be made, too, for the retention of the servants.
</p>

<p>
Ryder was at once elected by acclamation to head
this committee.  The colonel refused to be a
member.
</p>

<p>
"You want cool men&mdash;calm men, suh," said the
bristling old fellow.  "I am a fire-eater.  I'd rather
wring that skunk's neck than take a drink!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Colonel!" exclaimed Jimson, "that is a very
strong statement."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  But it's a fact.  I know my
weaknesses," said the colonel modestly.
</p>

<p>
First the committee were to make sure of the
truth of the manager's statement regarding the
coal supply.  Then they were to sound the help
through the steward, Al, to find out how many
would remain.  To learn what the prospect was for
feeding the people in the house, including the help,
was likewise important.
</p>

<p>
"If the coal gives out," Ryder said, "there is
surely coal in the village here that may be bought.
Perhaps not tonight, but early in the morning.  We
should be able to find oil lamps and heaters in that
big store which I see is still open for business.  The
town has no gas plant, I understand.  We are
dependent upon the hotel's lighting plant."
</p>

<p>
The committee divided to attend to several of
these matters before going to see Bangs, agreeing
to meet at the desk in ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
"I must not leave Ruth alone any longer,"
thought John Ryder, pulling himself up short.  "By
thunder! there must be something more important
for a bridegroom to do on his wedding night than
running about as I am, shouldering other people's
troubles.  I must go and take a peep at the dear
girl and cheer her up a bit.  She'll be frightened by
my remaining so long away, perhaps.  No doubt
she has heard by this time of the manager's threat."
</p>

<p>
As his suite was on the second floor he did not use
the elevator, but ran up the broad, main stairway
which led out of the office.  Here the hotel seemed
to be running in its usual quiet way.
</p>

<p>
A white-capped and aproned maid passed him;
a bellboy bustled by with a tray of pitchers in which
the ice tinkled; he heard the dull whir of the
elevators.  He walked along the broad, central corridor
and turned off at his own proper "alley."
</p>

<p>
He saw that the door of his suite was open.
There were voices which reached his quickened
ear&mdash;a man's deep tones and then (and this
startled him) a woman's sharp cry.
</p>

<p>
He was not yet sufficiently familiar with Ruth's
voice to recognize its tone under stress of emotion.
But he felt, somehow, that it was her cry.
</p>

<p>
He quickened his step.  There was a man standing
in the doorway of the suite.  Instantly, from
the side view Ryder obtained of his face, he knew
him to be the stranger who had come last to the
hotel on this fateful evening.
</p>

<p>
"The bungling fool!" thought John Ryder.  "Is
he going from room to room in this hotel looking
for his friends?  Maybe he is not honest.  The
disturbed state of the hotel guests would open very
easily the way to business for an industrious burglar."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't know you," Ruth said just as Ryder
reached the spot.
</p>

<p>
She stood within the room, clinging with both
hands to the edge of the door and staring at the
stranger with such a wild look in her eyes that her
husband was frightened.  He turned on the man
furiously.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?  What are you disturbing
this lady for?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," stammered the stranger,
backing away from both John Ryder and the open
door of his suite, his face now displaying nothing
but pain and anxiety.  "I have made a mistake&mdash;a
terrible mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am so glad you have come," Ruth said
quickly to Ryder.  "I&mdash;I thought you were lost&mdash;or
something had happened.  And then this man
came&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was still staring at the stranger with eyes
in which lurked actual terror.  Ryder's fierce aspect
seemed to trouble the strange man.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;and the lady's," he murmured.
"I thought I was acquainted with her.  It&mdash;it
is a mistake."
</p>

<p>
"I never saw him in my life!" gasped Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right.  Mistakes will happen," said
Ryder, and entered the room, shutting the door
abruptly in the man's face.  He caught Ruth quickly
in his arms with a sort of fierceness this time that
was his man-way of claiming possession, as well as
a desire to defend her from annoyance.  "Were
you frightened, dearie?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He&mdash;he startled me so.  He is a strange
looking man.  Do you think him quite&mdash;quite
right?"
</p>

<p>
"Not right to come bungling up here and
disturbing you," Ryder responded, tenderly.
</p>

<p>
She blushed, slipping out of his arms suddenly.
"Here, dear," she said softly.  "I have a visitor."
</p>

<p>
Ryder looked down the room and saw for the
first time a large, smiling woman sitting in a chair
beyond the line of half-unpacked trunks.  She was
a person whom he knew he had never seen before,
and he was not particularly happy to see her now.
</p>

<p>
She was a richly dressed&mdash;indeed a gaudily
dressed&mdash;person wearing many jewels and lacking
that quiet demeanor and appearance that Ryder
admired most in womankind.  Nevertheless, he walked
in with as good a grace as he could summon while
Ruth introduced him.
</p>

<p>
"This is my husband, Mrs. Judson," she said,
and there was a thrill of pride in her sweet voice
that delighted the man.  "Mrs. Judson has been
telling me how dreadfully this Mr. Bangs, the hotel
manager, is behaving.  Are they actually going
to close the hotel?  Mrs. Judson is all upset about
it.  Being alone here with only a maid, she doesn't
know what to do."
</p>

<p>
"A committee of the older guests is trying to
arrange now to keep the house open in spite of
Bangs," said John Ryder.  "But Bangs is a sharper.
He may have fixed things so that we shall be
without light or heat for a part of the night.  But
to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" broke in the large lady in horror.
"I'll never dare stay in my rooms in the dark.  And
all stark alone.  What <i>shall</i> I do?  You know how
very helpless we widows feel, Mister&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"  She
did not speak the name, which evidently had escaped
her, but her smirk caused Ryder a feeling of sudden
nausea.
</p>

<p>
"You don't look helpless," he thought, with much
disapproval of the visitor.  Mrs. Judson gave one
the impression of being a woman amply able to take
care of herself in any emergency.  Aloud he said:
</p>

<p>
"There are men now seeing about obtaining
candles and lamps.  Perhaps heat may be furnished
some of the rooms with the aid of oil stoves.  Of
course, the furnace fires are not out yet."
</p>

<p>
"It is not cold in here," Ruth said brightly.
</p>

<p>
"But it will be if what Bangs says is true.  He
hasn't coal enough to last until midnight.  Oh, he
was ready weeks ago for this trick, without any
doubt."
</p>

<p>
"And we can't get away!" wailed the heavy
woman in the armchair.  "When poor, dear Horace
was alive nothing like this ever happened to me.
And an oil stove!  Horrid, smelly things!  Oh, I
never could sleep with one in my room!  I am
delicate, you know, quite delicate!  Dear Horace always
took the greatest care of me!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder looked at the huge, over-fed woman before
him, and had some difficulty to keep from snorting
aloud at her claim of delicate health.
</p>

<p>
"And candles!" she wailed on.  "You surely
can't expect a woman to dress and undress by the
aid of candle light!  Oh, it's all horrid&mdash;perfectly
horrid!"
</p>

<p>
She seemed on the verge of tears, and from her
size Ryder expected nothing less than a deluge.  He
made for the door.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see what can be done about it," he whispered
to Ruth, who followed him swiftly, to squeeze his
hand in both her own.  "Don't you be troubled,
dearie.  I will not remain away long."
</p>

<p>
"I was troubled," she confessed in the same tone.
"Then I sent a bellboy to page you and he couldn't
find you anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"The stupid!  I was right down there in the
foyer.  We'll be all right when this tangle is
straightened out.  But, for the beginning of a
honeymoon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she suddenly giggled.  "Isn't it just too
<i>funny</i>?  Shall we really stay?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure.  Dispossessing a manager who won't
pay his rent is all right; but to try to dispossess
a guest who is ready and willing to pay is quite
another matter.  It can't be done."
</p>

<p>
"Then shall I continue to unpack my trunks?"
</p>

<p>
Ryder smiled at her, then glanced back at the
boxes.  They were more than half empty already
and the open wardrobe doors gave him a view of
a number of pretty gowns which Ruth had shaken
out and hung away.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead," he said, easily.  "You'll want the
furbelows out of the boxes, anyway.  They look
as though they'd muss pretty easily."
</p>

<p>
She glanced at him sidewise with a little blush,
and squeezed his hand again.  "Don't you think
they're <i>sweet</i>?" she whispered.  "I made them
almost all myself."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?" responded Ryder, with another
curious glance at the gowns in display.  Then he
went out and she closed the door after him.  When
he had walked half the length of the corridor he
halted and came near going back to the suite again.
Two startling facts had finally made an impression
on his busy mind.
</p>

<p>
One was the nature of Ruth's wardrobe.  Ryder
was not much versed in women's apparel, and all
those pretty, dainty, gray and cream colored dresses
could mean but one thing.  To his mind, they were
bride's gowns.
</p>

<p>
He had met his wife first aboard the <i>Minnequago</i>
and had known her just seven days before they
were married.  He had seen her wear no dress on
shipboard like these she had brought out of her
trunks.  Indeed, Miss Mont had been gowned with
severity and with no more style than the
average English woman displays.
</p>

<p>
"Why," muttered Ryder, "she has a complete
bridal outfit&mdash;or, it seems so to me.  How could
she have got those dresses?  And she says she made
them herself!"
</p>

<p>
He turned back, but bethought him of Mrs. Judson.
He could have no private word with Ruth
now.  So he walked slowly on toward the main
stairway, and his mind reverted to the second
puzzling circumstance he had noted.  There were few
if any labels on his wife's trunks.
</p>

<p>
No trunk can cross the ocean without being plastered
over with the various marks and stamps of the
European agencies, and of the steamship companies.
It was a small matter, perhaps&mdash;this lack of
the usual labels&mdash;but it continued to puzzle John
Ryder until he had descended to the office once
more and found himself again in the thick of the
circumstances connected with the attempt of the
hotel manager to turn his guests out of house and
home.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
BUSINESS METHODS
</h3>

<p>
The members of the committee had regathered
and were awaiting their chairman.  Matters had
been found to be in a much worse condition than the
guests had really believed.
</p>

<p>
From the steward they had learned that the
whole kitchen was disorganized, and had been so
for some days.  He had had the greatest difficulty
in preventing an eruption there.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" demanded Ryder, having been told this.
</p>

<p>
"They are afraid they will lose their pay.  These
French and Italians are easily excited anyway,"
explained Jimson, who was not a little excited
himself.  "The waiters and the upstairs help are in a
blue funk for the same reason."
</p>

<p>
"How about the coal?" Ryder asked another man.
</p>

<p>
"It's every whit as bad as Bangs said.  There is
only a little furnace coal.  If they use the coal
intended for the kitchen fires there would not be
enough to keep the boilers warm until daylight."
</p>

<p>
"Hang that Bangs!"
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart," agreed Ryder, grimly.
"But that will not get us any coal tonight&mdash;nor keep
the hotel warmed and lighted."
</p>

<p>
"The scoundrel certainly deserves to figure in a
necktie party," growled one man.  "My wife's in
hysterics upstairs right now."
</p>

<p>
"Let us interview this Bangs before he gets
away," Ryder said.  "I understand he has really
given orders to shut everything down at nine
o'clock, and it only lacks ten minutes of that time
now."
</p>

<p>
The committee moved in a body on the private
office.  The door was closed, but Ryder did not give
the manager a chance to refuse them admittance.
He entered without knocking and the other determined
men filed in.  Bangs sat at his desk scratching
off a letter at a furious pace.  But he dropped
his pen and turned toward them with a snarl.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it now?"
</p>

<p>
"We want your attention for a few moments,
Mr. Bangs," John Ryder said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Who the deuce are you?" demanded the hotel
manager.  "You're not like Brack and Jimson and
these other old stagers, who have been here so
long they think they own the house.  I never
remember of seeing you before."
</p>

<p>
Ryder handed him his card.  "That is my name,"
he said, "and I came into this house for the first
time tonight.  That, however, is quite aside from
the matter we have come to discuss.
</p>

<p>
"We, the guests of this hotel, cannot be treated
in this cavalier manner, Mr. Bangs.  We will not
stand for it.  There will be damage suits after this
night's work if you dare follow out your program&mdash;damage
suits against the Barnaby estate of course.
But I, for one, shall not be satisfied until I see you
properly punished unless you immediately change
your attitude."
</p>

<p>
He spoke so firmly, and the threatening attitude
of his co-workers was so impressive, that the
manager began to cower.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I can't do a thing!" he began; but John
Ryder stopped him with raised hand.
</p>

<p>
"We demand your co-operation in keeping the
hotel force together until the owners can be
communicated with and until they send somebody to
take charge here in your place."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be hanged if I will!" cried Bangs, jumping up.
</p>

<p>
"And you may be hanged if you don't," declared
another of the committee, putting a rather broad
back against the office door.
</p>

<p>
Again Bangs cowered.  These five men might do
him bodily injury if they wished to.
</p>

<p>
"I can't do a thing, I tell you," he whined.
"There's no coal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We know all about that," Ryder interrupted
sternly.  "And we know why there is none.  You
knew this dispossessory proceeding was pending,
and you made your plans to checkmate Giddings by
shutting up the hotel in this way.  Without regard
for the comfort of your guests or the rights of your
employees, you have tried to whip your enemy,
Giddings, over our shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Now we, the guests, have taken the affair into
our hands inasmuch as we propose to keep the hotel
open and make the ladies and children, at least, as
comfortable as may be.  And we shall not let you
leave, Mr. Bangs, until you have done all in your
power to repair the damage you have already
done."
</p>

<p>
"What can I do?" snarled the manager.  "I'm
not going to pay for heat and light and for service
in a hotel which I no longer manage."
</p>

<p>
"You are legally in charge here until the Court
puts you out."
</p>

<p>
"I'll not run this hotel for that Giddings after
he's served me in dispossess proceedings," Bangs
said, turned sullen.
</p>

<p>
"You will help us make the house as comfortable
as possible until we can communicate with this
Giddings and inform him of what has occurred,"
said Ryder quietly but severely.  "You have given
orders for everything to shut down at nine o'clock.
You must rescind that command."
</p>

<p>
"You can none of you get away after that hour,"
Bangs said.
</p>

<p>
"Nor at that time," said Ryder promptly.  "If
any of your guests are going on that jerkwater
train they are already over there at the station.
But the stampede of the help must be stopped."
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me to do?" growled Bangs,
rather afraid of this determined John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"To tell the engineers to keep the dynamos and
boilers running as long as they have a shovelful of
coal.  Likewise to send word throughout the building
for all employees who wish to retain their
situations under the new management&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What new management?" cried Bangs, leaping
up again.
</p>

<p>
"The management which will follow your
régime," Ryder told him coolly.  "You do not
suppose for a moment, do you, that the owners of this
property will allow the hotel to close?"
</p>

<p>
Bangs grinned like an angry dog.  "I don't care
a hang what they do," he said.  "I only know I'm
out of it."
</p>

<p>
"You're not out of it yet, Mr. Bangs," Ryder
grimly said.  "Telephone to the engine room at
once."
</p>

<p>
The manager picked up the receiver with bad
grace.  "You are intimidating me," he complained.
</p>

<p>
"You bet we are!" exclaimed the man with his
back to the door.  "And thank your lucky stars we
don't manhandle you in the bargain."
</p>

<p>
Ryder raised his hand for silence and the manager
gave the order to the engineer.  "Now," said
Ryder, "call the head chef and have him inform
the kitchen help that the hotel will not be closed and
that their wages will be paid."
</p>

<p>
"Who's going to pay 'em?" demanded Bangs.
</p>

<p>
"You do as you are told.  The courts will decide
that."
</p>

<p>
Bangs began to bluster; then he caught the look
in the eye of the man with his back against the
door and he once more subsided.  Together, Ryder
and the burly committeeman were too much for
Bangs' courage.
</p>

<p>
The steward was called in; likewise George, the
clerk on duty.  The two were told, Bangs agreeing
doggedly, that the employees of the hotel were to
be pacified and the guests to be made as comfortable
as possible until Giddings could be communicated
with.
</p>

<p>
Then the committee of five went back to the
crowd in the foyer and reported progress.  Colonel
Brack led in acclaiming them public benefactors.
But their work was not yet finished.
</p>

<p>
Those who knew, declared there was no possibility
of finding even a small supply of coal without
considerable delay.  The hotel manager had had an
arrangement with the railroad company to furnish
coal by the carload, and the local dealers would not
put themselves out to accommodate the hotel now.
Indeed, Bangs had made himself locally disliked.
</p>

<p>
"The best we can do is to send our committee
over to Cal Crabtree's store and buy up all the lamps
and oil stoves he's got in stock," Colonel Brack
said.  "I'd head such a foraging party if it wasn't
for my artificial limb.  I'm afraid I'll get rheumatism
in that if I go out at night," and the jovial
colonel chuckled.
</p>

<p>
But when it was vociferously agreed that the
already elected committee, of which John Ryder
was chairman, should do this purchasing and it had
started out to do what Colonel Brack suggested, one
of them observed:
</p>

<p>
"Now, isn't that the colonel all over?  That bum
peg of his keeps him out of a lot of trouble.  He's
off this committee because some of us will have to
put up money and then run the risk of getting it
back from the estate, or from that slippery Bangs.
The colonel gets cold in that artificial foot plaguey
easy if the cards go against him at poker."
</p>

<p>
And indeed, before they got to the general store,
the committee was in a wrangle over this very thing.
Who was going to put up the money for the lamps
and stoves?  Nobody seemed to care to step info
the breech.  John Ryder listened and said nothing
at first.  Finally he suggested:
</p>

<p>
"Let's divide it among us.  Think of the
ladies&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let those who have got 'em, think of 'em,"
snapped one bachelor.  "That's nothing in my young
sweet life."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, Long, you wouldn't mind putting up
a share for Mrs. Judson, would you?" chuckled
another.
</p>

<p>
"By jove! that's what I am afraid of," declared
the bachelor.  "If the widow ever heard I put up
money to buy her an oil heater, she'd have me in
court in breach of promise proceedings."
</p>

<p>
It was evident the large lady was a standing joke
among the men at the hotel.  Ryder frowned.  He
was sorry that she had forced her society on Ruth.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the four other members of the committee
agreed that they would not put their hands
in their pockets.  On the very steps of the store
they halted and vociferously stated this decision.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go back and take up a collection," said
the bachelor member.  "I know those ginks back
there.  There are more hard boiled eggs in that
bunch at Pinewood Inn than you could find anywhere
else along the coast.  I'm not going to be
nicked for more than my share."
</p>

<p>
With this his brother-committeemen seemed to
agree.  All but Ryder.  The latter looked at his
watch.  It was already half after nine.  There was
every sign as they came along the street that the
villagers were retiring for the night; and as they
stood discussing the matter the proprietor of the
store began to put out his lights.
</p>

<p>
"You can go back and ask for further instructions
if you wish to, gentlemen," said Ryder in
disgust.  "But I will go in and see what I can do.
There is no time to waste."
</p>

<p>
"At your peril, Mr. Ryder," said one.  "Don't
drag us into it."
</p>

<p>
"I never forced a man into a deal yet&mdash;especially
if he was a bad loser," declared John Ryder, and
turned his back on the others to enter the store
alone.
</p>

<p>
He found the proprietor, a shrewd, long-headed
countryman, ready to be affable, or businesslike, as
the case might be.  Ryder knew well how to tackle
such a character.  He had been doing business with
all kinds of men all his life.  He went directly to
the point of the matter.
</p>

<p>
"I want every oil lamp you've got in the shop,
and all your candles, and those oil heaters yonder.
If you have oil, I want a barrel.  And I want you
to find me a truckman right now to cart 'em over
to the hotel.  I'll give you cash, or my check, in
full for the whole amount.  What say?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a bargain," laconically said the storekeeper,
and there was little haggling either, over the price
of the articles bought.  Ryder did not believe that
Crabtree was over-reaching him on that point, for
he seemed to sympathize with the situation of the
people in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
"That bridge breaking down is a bad business.
Foolish, too," Crabtree agreed.  "The Highway
Department of this town is about as useful as a
left-handed boot to a man who's only got a wooden leg
on that side of him.  And let me tell you,
Mr. Ryder, the bridge won't be repaired again in a
hurry.  Nothing ever is done in a hurry by our road
menders and bridge builders."
</p>

<p>
Ryder was more intimately interested in the
supplies he could buy.  There were two full boxes of
so-called "waxlights" and a box of tallow candles
of the double-six size.  There were over a hundred
lamps of all kinds and sizes, and the oil stoves
numbered twenty-three.  The check Ryder made
out was a substantial one.
</p>

<p>
In half an hour he was back at the hotel where
the guests were wrangling in the foyer over how
the bill for supplies should be apportioned.  The
other members of the committee were finally
instructed to pay for the goods out of a collection
of about two hundred dollars that had been
grudgingly made.
</p>

<p>
"Here's Ryder!" exclaimed Colonel Brack, red-faced
and excited.  "He should head this committee
again.  He is a chap who <i>does</i> things.  Ryder
forever!"
</p>

<p>
The colonel's evening potations began to show
upon him.  Ryder tried to brush by on his way to
the desk.
</p>

<p>
"You're just the man we want on this committee,"
reiterated the colonel, following him.
</p>

<p>
"What committee?" the business man asked.
</p>

<p>
"The committee on buying supplies."
</p>

<p>
"It discharged itself half an hour ago," said
Ryder, bruskly.  "And now there is nothing for it
to do."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" gasped several, including the colonel,
who asked the question truculently.
</p>

<p>
John Ryder bit off the end of his cigar and lit it
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"As far as I know, gentlemen, I've bought up
every lamp, every oil stove, every candle, and all
the surplus supply of oil in this village tonight.  I
bought them on to my own private account.  If I
decide to resell them I'll let you know later."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
SHOCK UPON SHOCK
</h3>

<p>
The clamor of those who heard John Ryder's
statement drew most of the crowd surging toward
the desk, before which the business man stood.
Colonel Brack, reddening and with glittering eyes,
advanced upon Ryder with his "step-clump" stride,
demanding:
</p>

<p>
"Suh! do you call this a gentlemanly thing to do?
Why, suh, the women and children in this hotel are
at your mercy.  It's an outrage, suh!"
</p>

<p>
"The rest of the committee backed out on the
steps of the store," said Ryder coolly.  "Time was
passing."
</p>

<p>
"Why, the money is already put up for the supplies,"
cried somebody with much bombast.
</p>

<p>
"Not for these supplies that I have obtained,"
said Ryder decisively.  "In the first place two
hundred dollars will not go far toward the purchase of
the goods."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to profit upon our necessities, do you,
Mr. Ryder?" cried Jimson shrilly.
</p>

<p>
"Shylock!" exclaimed another of the angry men.
</p>

<p>
Ryder turned his back upon them and approached
George.
</p>

<p>
"I've bought the stuff," he said shortly.  "It was
a perfectly legitimate transaction."
</p>

<p>
"By gad, suh!" reiterated the wrathful colonel,
"you have taken an unfair advantage of a party
of gentlemen who trusted you.  You're a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Ryder failed to hear the remainder of the colonel's
sputterings.  But a voice nearer to his ear
could not be drowned.  This said:
</p>

<p>
"By George! that Ryder's a cleaner.  He was
never known to let a good chance slip in the Street,
they say, and I can believe it.  He's got us where
the hair's short&mdash;and it's our own fault."
</p>

<p>
John Ryder was angry.  The manner in which
the other members of the committee had dodged
financial responsibility and were now declaiming
against his "grasping" methods, exasperated him.
He would not give them the satisfaction of an
explanation.  He took nobody but the steward and
the clerk into his confidence.
</p>

<p>
It was while he was discussing matters with
these two employees of the hotel that the engineer
sent up word that he had been forced to bank the
fires under the boilers, but that the dynamos would
be kept running until midnight.
</p>

<p>
"That man seems faithful," Ryder observed.
"Has word been sent around for the help to come
together for a talk with us?  We want to know how
many will remain here."
</p>

<p>
The steward turned red and blurted out: "I
don't believe&mdash;that is, it will be difficult to get
many of them together, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It is believed that Mr. Bangs will not pay wages
beyond today, and the men and girls are deserting.
Some went on that nine o'clock train, and others
have found means of getting away from the hotel."
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" ejaculated Ryder.  "Where's
Bangs?  We'll get what's left of the help together
and make him assure them&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't think Mr. Bangs is here," hesitated
George.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't help his going, sir.  I could not hold
him by force, you know.  You gentlemen should
have had him watched."
</p>

<p>
"What has he done?" asked Ryder, recovering
his calmness.
</p>

<p>
"Right after you gentlemen left I heard him
telephoning to the railroad station.  The operator and
agent were not there, but the conductor of that
combination was.  He's a friend of Bangs'.  The
train was held ten minutes.  It did not get away
until ten minutes past nine.  And I think Mr. Bangs
went on it."
</p>

<p>
"And his going has disorganized the whole household,"
the steward added, sadly.  "The chef has
the kitchen fairly under control now.  He's an
Italian&mdash;Vitalli is his name&mdash;not a bad fellow at
all and attached to the house rather than to
Bangs&mdash;as I am and George, here, is."
</p>

<p>
"You believe the estate will do the right thing
by you?" Ryder asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the steward.  "The heirs will not
wish the house closed.  In such a way, too!  They
would consider it a disgrace.  Pinewood Inn is one
of the oldest hotels on the coast.  This Mr. Giddings,
the lawyer, doesn't know much about the
hotel business, I fancy, or he would not have acted
so precipitately and given Mr. Bangs a chance to
put the guests out.  If all the help would work
together we'd come out all right.  But most of them
care nothing about the hotel or the welfare of its
guests," and the steward wagged his head.
</p>

<p>
"Where are the other clerks?" Ryder asked of
George.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Manger, the head clerk, went to town day
before yesterday.  Somehow, I feel that he had
some wind of what was coming.  But heaven knows
<i>I</i> didn't, Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"Or you would have gone, likewise?" asked the
man of business, with a grim smile, but watching
the ruddy young fellow with his plastered yellow
hair in some curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;no," hesitated George.  "I think I should
have hung on in any case.  You see," he added,
"I'm rather fond of a scrap.  And Jim Howe&mdash;he
relieves me at midnight&mdash;<i>he'll</i> see it through, no
fear!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, gentlemen," Ryder finally said with a
sigh, "there doesn't seem to be much now that we
can do save to sit tight.  You two influence all the
employees you can to stick by the ship.  These lights
and stoves and oil are already at the door, I have
no doubt.  You take charge of them all," he said to
the steward, "and get somebody to fix up the lamps
and fill them.  But give none of them out until
George, here, has listed them.  He knows more
about the guests and their needs than any of us, I
presume."
</p>

<p>
Ryder had no time to go upstairs just then; but
fearing Ruth would be again disturbed by his
continued absence, he scratched off a little note and
handed it to one of the boys.
</p>

<p>
"Now, give that to nobody but Mrs. Ryder," he
told the boy, remembering Mrs. Judson, who he
feared might still be hovering about the suite.
</p>

<p>
Ryder observed that the male guests who had
heretofore been so friendly with him now eyed him
askance and that Colonel Brack had gathered
around him a group that he was haranguing vigorously.
By the fiery glances cast in his direction by
the old campaigner Ryder was quite sure Brack
spoke of him.
</p>

<p>
"I am certainly getting <i>persona non grata</i> in this
hotel," murmured Ryder, with grim humor.
</p>

<p>
Then, of a sudden, he saw that one of those
listening to Colonel Brack was the man who had
disturbed Ruth at the door of their suite.  Ryder
turned back to speak once more with the clerk:
</p>

<p>
"Who is that fellow?" he asked, calling George's
attention to the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"That man?  Let's see&mdash;he came tonight.  Refused
to be turned away although at that time, being
under Mr. Bangs' instructions, I told him we could
not accommodate him.  And I have not yet assigned
him a room.  But his name's White."
</p>

<p>
George whirled the register about and pointed to
the last name on the page.  Ryder murmured it
over to himself: "'John B. White, Rome.'
</p>

<p>
"Rome, what?  New York, Georgia, or the original
home of the Cæsar family?" Ryder asked carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, sir.  He just wrote that down.
I don't really know what do to with him.  I think
from something he dropped that he came here
expecting to find friends."
</p>

<p>
"And didn't find them?"  Ryder's curiosity
prompted him to demand.
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't seemed to."
</p>

<p>
"Who are his friends?  Don't you know their
names?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;  Well, I declare, sir, he did mention
one name.  That of a Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;  Well, it
escapes me," said George, in confusion.  "It was
just at the outburst of this trouble, and I was all
mixed up.  I am sure it was a lady he asked me
about.  Perhaps it is a runaway match and the
lady has backed out," and George chuckled at his
own joke.
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't act much like a bridegroom,"
observed Ryder, still watching White.
</p>

<p>
"I might say that about you, Mr. Ryder,"
ventured the clerk slyly.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder! that's so," admitted Ryder.  "Nor
do I feel like one.  This is a nice mess for a fellow
to get into at such a time.  I can't say that I am
glad I came to Pinewood Inn for my honeymoon,
George."
</p>

<p>
But as he strolled away from the hotel desk his
mind was still fixed on the man, White.  He
remembered the bellboy coming through the foyer
paging "John B. White" and saying that Mrs. White
wanted him upstairs.  Now, hang it! if Mrs.
White was here, didn't the hotel clerk know her?
</p>

<p>
"Odd&mdash;deucedly odd," thought John Ryder.
"And how startled that fellow was when he heard
the boy.  Or was he?  Not a bad looking fellow;
but he's queer.  Ruth says he is touched in the
upper story, and I believe myself that some of his
buttons are loose.
</p>

<p>
"Or, if he is a crook&mdash;and that would not be so
strange," added Ryder, letting his mind run upon
this train of thought.  "A crook with a woman
accomplice in this hotel might easily make a good
haul tonight, considering the state affairs are in.
I wonder if there isn't a detective attached to
Pinewood Inn."
</p>

<p>
Before he could turn back to ask George about
this, his attention was attracted from the man,
White, to an old gentleman who had just left the
elevator leaning on the arm of a colored man.  The
old fellow was in some excitement, and he hobbled
quickly to the desk, his gray hair bristling from
under the rim of the round black cap he wore, his
feet shuffling in gay carpet slippers.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that he had retired to his room
for the night, and had made himself comfortable
there.  Something had routed him out and he had
merely shrugged himself into a coat before coming
down to the office.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, sir!  Look here, sir!" the old man
cried, shaking his cane at George in a hand that
quivered with palsy.  "What does this mean?  How
dare that Bangs turn us out of the hotel in such a
way?  I'll write Mr. Giddings about it.  Mr. Giddings
is my friend.  He will not see me so insulted
and annoyed."
</p>

<p>
Ryder heard an amused bystander say:
</p>

<p>
"Here's old Pop Cudger; he's on the warpath,
too.  Now there'll be something doing."
</p>

<p>
"Get him and the colonel together and there will
be fireworks, sure enough," agreed another man,
with a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
George was trying to pacify the angry old man,
but the latter would not accord the clerk's
explanation much attention.
</p>

<p>
"It is nonsense!  It is preposterous!" cried
Mr. Cudger.  "Mr. Giddings is my friend&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And if Giddings hadn't been so anxious to put
Bangs out we wouldn't all be in this pickle,"
somebody remarked loud enough for Mr. Cudger to
hear.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" exclaimed the latter, turning a withering
glance upon the speaker, and then immediately
turning back to George.  "Is it true that the lights
are to be put out?"
</p>

<p>
"The dynamos can't run later than midnight.
Then the lights will naturally have to be shut off
all over the hotel, Mr. Cudger.  I'm sorry, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lights turned out&mdash;and half the help running
away?" cried Cudger.  "Next thing, I suppose,
James, here, will be leaving me in the lurch," and he
glared at the colored man.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, suh!  I'se gwine to stay right heah by
yo'," declared James.
</p>

<p>
"And what's going to become of my picture?"
demanded the old gentleman, beginning on another
tack.  "What provision has been made to guard my
picture, sir&mdash;&mdash;  Van Scamp's famous 'Cheesemonger'?
That was hung in the parlor by special
permission of Mr. Giddings, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think anybody will touch your picture,
Mr. Cudger," said the clerk, soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  How do you know that?  In the state of
confusion the house is now in, some vandal might
easily cut the canvas out of its frame.  It cost me
many thousands of dollars, sir&mdash;and it's the finest
example of Van Scamp's art in existence today.  I
will not trust it unguarded in that parlor under
present circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"But I can't furnish a watchman to guard your
picture," George urged.
</p>

<p>
"Well, where's the house detective?" demanded
the old gentleman.  "I must have protection for
my picture."
</p>

<p>
"You certainly can't expect Miss Solomons to
stand guard over it!" the clerk exclaimed.  "You'd
better have it removed to your room."
</p>

<p>
"You clown!" exclaimed the crotchety old man.
"It wouldn't go through the door of my room.
That is why it has to be hung in your miserable
parlor."  And as the clerk restrained both his
temper and his tongue, he added: "If you will not
furnish a watchman&mdash;and Mr. Giddings shall hear
of your refusal, sir!&mdash;then James will have to guard
the picture."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no suh!" murmured the colored man.  "Dat
ain't no place fo' me all night.  No, suh!  Yo'
might need me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You will have to do it, James," repeated the
old man.  "If the lights go out what is going to
prevent that canvas being cut out of the frame?"
</p>

<p>
"Das jest it, suh!" rejoined the colored man.
"I don't want to stay dere in de dark&mdash;no, suh!"
</p>

<p>
"You are a coward, James&mdash;a pusillanimous coward!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, suh!  Dat may be, suh.  But yo' might
need me in de night."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shall need you.  I'll likely have one
of my choking spells&mdash;or something.  But I can't
risk losing my Van Scamp.  We shall both have
to watch it, James.  We will camp in the parlor all
night.
</p>

<p>
"Young man," turning to George, "have a bed
brought into the parlor for me.  I will sleep there,
and James shall keep watch."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Cudger, that is the main parlor of the
hotel.  We cannot very easily let you sleep there,"
cried the distracted George.
</p>

<p>
At this point Ryder lost interest in the entire
affair.  The boy he had sent upstairs with the note
to Ruth tugged at his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"I can't find the lady, sir," he said, returning the
letter to Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Can't find who?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Ryder, sir."
</p>

<p>
The man was amazed, and for an instant he was
a little frightened.  "Where did you go, boy?" he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"To Suite Three&mdash;where you told me.  She
wasn't there."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know she wasn't there?"
</p>

<p>
"The lady told me so.  The lady who was there.
She told me I'd made a mistake."
</p>

<p>
Ryder started for the staircase, his mind in a
whirl.  Where could Ruth have gone?  Possibly to
Mrs. Judson's apartment.  Yet if so, who had met
the boy and sent him away from Suite Three with
such a message?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE BRIDAL NIGHT
</h3>

<p>
The excitement among the guests had now spread
to the floors above.  Too, there was a noticeable
dearth of serving people.  In the parlor on this
second floor into which Ryder glanced curiously on
his way to his own rooms, was a crowd of women
with a sprinkling of husbands, discussing the
situation in varying degrees of anxiety.
</p>

<p>
The corridors and parlor were ablaze with electric
lights, and Ryder saw the great picture, covering
half the further end-wall of the room, about
which Mr. Cudger was making such a row at the
clerk's desk.
</p>

<p>
An especially arranged string of lights over the
picture cast the proper glow upon it.  It really was
the work of a master of color, but that its owner
should consider it in danger of suffering the fate
of some of the great paintings that have been stolen,
rather amused John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
While he stood for a moment looking at the picture
he realized that a sudden hush had fallen upon
the several groups in the parlor, and he saw that
the majority of the guests there assembled were
staring at him.  Whether their interest was aroused
because he was a bridegroom or because he had
cornered the lighting and heating supplies of the
village, the man of business did not know&mdash;nor did
he care.  He shrugged his shoulders and passed on.
</p>

<p>
A bridegroom!  Well, this did not seem a very
fortunate beginning for one's honeymoon.  Another
man might have easily slipped from under the duties
that had settled on John Ryder's shoulders.  But it
was his way, when he saw things going wrong, to
step in and right them.
</p>

<p>
He had given his mind to this business of trying
to bring some order out of the chaotic condition of
affairs in the hotel with as much zest as he ever
gave to business matters.  Now, as he approached
the apartment in which he and Ruth had expected
to be so happy in each other's society for the next
few weeks, he tried to throw off all the anxieties
that had recently accumulated in his mind.
</p>

<p>
This was his bridal night.  He had fallen in love
with the most beautiful and charming woman he
had ever met, and had married her offhand.  Were
it not for this troublesome matter of the hotel
closing, he would be the happiest man alive.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, he was the happiest man alive in any
case.  Had he not just been married to the loveliest
and sweetest girl in the world?  Was not <i>his wife</i>
(John Ryder almost strutted) waiting for him in
their rooms at this very moment?
</p>

<p>
Then a feeling of humility, unusual humility in
this successful business man who was accustomed
to getting what he wanted, overcame him.  What
was he to have won this jewel of a woman in so
short a time?  Seven days, and she had consented
to become his wife!  Men sometimes strove and
worked for the love of a woman for months&mdash;for
years!  But no&mdash;that could not be real love!  When
two people loved as he and Ruth loved, there was
no waiting in uncertainty.  They knew it&mdash;they
must know it&mdash;at once.
</p>

<p>
In spite of his thirty-five years and his
somewhat ruthless business career, John Ryder was
undoubtedly still very much of a boy.  And indeed,
in love matters, he was but a boy, inasmuch as never
before had he even imagined himself in love.
</p>

<p>
"Confound this old ranch, anyway!" John Ryder
muttered.  "Why should I bother my head about
it&mdash;or about these silly folks in it?  I declare! we'll
find some way of getting out of the pickle ourselves
tomorrow morning and go to some place where we
can enjoy our honeymoon undisturbed."
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered that Ruth had chosen Pinewood
particularly.  It might be only a whim on her
part; but he was in a mind just then to satisfy even
her whims, if it could be done.
</p>

<p>
"This man, Giddings, will show up, and things
will probably be running all right before tomorrow
night.  And Ruth&mdash;God bless that sweet name!&mdash;has
taken all the trouble to unpack.  By thunder!"
he added, "it's funny about those dresses of hers.
I must ask her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He had come to the door and opened it softly&mdash;so
softly indeed that the occupant of the room did
not hear him.  His heart throbbed and his eyes
actually smarted with unshed drops as he looked
down the long apartment and saw his wife sitting
reading in the radiance of the drop-light at the
table.
</p>

<p>
She was alone.  The other lights had been
extinguished, and she sat awaiting his return,
evidently with her mind not wholly upon the book in
her lap, for she turned no leaves while Ryder
watched her.
</p>

<p>
In her attitude and in the loosely flowing gown
she had donned since dinner, she made a delightful
picture.  Ryder drank in the details as he stood,
shrinking from breaking the spell of her reverie.
</p>

<p>
It was by no means a sad mood which held her,
for her lips slowly parted in a most ravishing smile.
He could see this, though it was her profile only he
watched from his station at the door.
</p>

<p>
He was about to close the latter softly when she
dropped her book and her fingers fluttered about
her throat for a moment.  She loosened her gown
there, thrust one hand within the laces, and drew
forth a tiny object attached to a thin gold chain
which he had already noticed about her throat.
The ornament she held for a moment in her palm
was a locket.
</p>

<p>
When she snapped it open and gazed upon what
it contained she turned a little so that he saw her
expression of countenance more clearly.  It startled
him.
</p>

<p>
He was a sane and level-headed man.  He was
thirty-five, and the foolish emotions of adolescence
should not have ruffled his calm.  Yet aboard the
steamship he had felt an unrecognized pang of
jealousy whenever he saw Miss Mont talking with
Marks, the theatrical man.  A similar pang smote
him now.
</p>

<p>
No human being ever looked as Ruth looked
unless the object of such gaze was a dearly loved
one, or the memento of a loved one!  While Ryder
watched, his wife raised the locket reverently and
pressed her lips to the object it contained.
</p>

<p>
He must have uttered some sound, or moved, or
the door latch clicked as he closed it.  She started,
saw him, and hastily concealed the locket in her
bosom, rising in some confusion to greet him.
</p>

<p>
The arrow of suspicion first driven into his
mind when he had seen that stranger at their door
and Ruth had seemed so frightened, was barbed.
Now that he sought to cast it out of his thought, it
rankled.
</p>

<p>
What! was he of a low, suspicious, jealous
nature?  Was he the kind of cur to make himself
and his wife miserable by a jealousy that was
insulting to them both?
</p>

<p>
This woman and he had known each other but
a short time before their hasty marriage, but
Ryder flattered himself that he had drawn from her
a rather full and connected story of her life up to
the day she had stepped aboard the <i>Minnequago</i>.
</p>

<p>
There had been nothing in her story, he was
positive, of which she needed to be ashamed.  There
had been no man but him.  She had told him that
frankly.
</p>

<p>
She might possess some keepsake; but only such
as an honorable wife might have.  He knew it&mdash;he
would stake his life upon it!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was some dear reminder of the mother
she had scarcely known.  He had carried his
mother's wedding ring all these years until he had
given it to the clergyman to slip on Ruth's finger.
He saw the glint of that ring now as she advanced
to meet him with hands outstretched and the same
light in her eyes that he had seen just now while
she bent above the locket.
</p>

<p>
"I am a fool!" bethought.  "A wicked fool."
</p>

<p>
He hurried down the room and clasped her yielding
body within the circle of his arms.  There was
a passion in his embrace which he had scarcely
expressed before, and she seemed to feel it.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest!" she whispered.  "I am glad you have
come back, I was getting lonesome again," and she
gave him her lips of her own accord.
</p>

<p>
The heart of John Ryder beat higher.  He
remembered what he had told her aboard ship:
</p>

<p>
"I'll never bring tears to your eyes, but always
laughter to your heart!"
</p>

<p>
"And a villain I'd be to break my word.  Now is
not the time to ask an explanation of such a simple
act.  It might show her how mean and vile a
thought I had," was his thought.
</p>

<p>
"I sent a message up to you a while ago, but the
boy seemed unable to find you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I never saw such stupid boys as they have
at this hotel!  Another knocked on our door while
Mrs. Judson was here and asked for somebody
else."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the guests are all around, visiting in each
other's rooms, I presume," he observed.  "The
whole household is upset.  And you never saw such
a lot of cranks as there are here in your life.  A
circus sideshow has no more freaks, I guess, than a
hotel like this Pinewood Inn."
</p>

<p>
Ryder, laughing, told of old Mr. Cudger and his
picture, and sketched the character of Colonel
Aurelius Brack.  Incidentally he told her something
of what had been done, though in an impersonal
way, to make the guests comfortable and to keep
the employees of the hotel on their jobs.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, John!" she cried, leading him to a
couch where they could sit side by side, "I thought
this was to be a vacation for both of us," looking
at him roguishly.  "A honeymoon!  It should begin
pretty soon, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to pack those trunks again and
leave in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
"No-o.  I want to stay here if we can.  But
can't some of the other men attend to all these
things?"
</p>

<p>
"They are attending to them.  They are discussing
them to beat the band!  But nobody seemed to
have any really practical ideas&mdash;not when it touched
their pocketbooks," and Ryder laughed grimly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going down once more to see about something
particular.  The dining-room is still open.  It
will be late before we get to bed, and you only
pecked at your dinner, I noticed.  Don't you want
to come down for a bite&mdash;or will it be too much
trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah-ha!" she said shaking a finger at him, "you
have the late-supper habit.  I believe you are a gay
boy.  I certainly shall not let my hubby go out alone
to suppers.  And&mdash;whisper it!&mdash;I am hungry.  I
was so excited when we arrived.  And people
stared so at us down there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They'll stare now," he said smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Especially if I should go down in this robe?"
and she blushed as she sprang up from the couch.
"I will put on one of my nicest and," looking at him
from across the room with sparkling eyes, "bridiest
gowns!"
</p>

<p>
She disappeared within the curtains of the
bedchamber.  Ryder started up.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by the way, about those gowns&mdash;" he began
awkwardly, when a summons at the door terminated
his proposed speech abruptly.  The steward
had sent up for him to come down in haste.  The
supplies from the store had arrived, and the guests
were clamoring at the storeroom door for a
distribution of the lamps and candles.
</p>

<p>
Ryder stepped back to the door of the inner room.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to run down again, Ruth," he said.
</p>

<p>
She uttered a little scream when he appeared in
the doorway; but then she came to kiss him without
affectation.  Her white shoulders and arms, bared
for the moment, almost dazzled him.  Ryder smiled
down into her eyes and saw in their depths what he
wished to see.
</p>

<p>
"Come below when you are ready.  There is a
little waiting room at the foot of the main stairway
and you can see all over the office from there.  I'll
probably see you come down; but if I'm not in sight,
go to the dining-room, if you like, and select a
table."
</p>

<p>
He said this, kissed her again, and hastened after
the steward's messenger.  Descending in the
elevator he found a crowd about the little office in
which the steward made up his accounts, just back
of the café.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Brack was foremost in the disturbance,
and when Ryder appeared the old campaigner
turned upon him wrathfully.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Ryder!" he exclaimed, "you can't do
this.  You must have some of the instincts of a
gentleman about you, and you should remember
the women&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can excuse a man who has been drinking,"
interposed Ryder sharply; "and I cannot strike a
cripple.  But I advise you to have a care how you
address me."
</p>

<p>
Brack threw himself forward at him; but two of
his friends held back the unsteady old fire-eater.
"By gad, suh, I'd call you out for that if you were
not such a dog, suh!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not dog enough to run at every fool's call,"
responded Ryder.  And then he ignored the sputtering
Brack, turning to the remainder of the party:
"Gentlemen, I shall see that you make no raid on
these supplies I have secured.  They are my private
property and I shall do with them as I see fit."
</p>

<p>
"My goodness, man! you don't intend to freeze
us out completely, do you?" gasped Jimson, whose
wife was an invalid.
</p>

<p>
"I shall distribute them as I choose and under
such terms as I see fit," Ryder repeated calmly.
"The steward is to have direct control of them.
Within the next hour, and before the electric lights
are put out, the matter will all be arranged.
</p>

<p>
"None of you at first wished to take any financial
responsibility for the good of the general herd.  I
took that responsibility.  Why should I not reap
my proper reward?" and he smiled at them grimly.
</p>

<p>
Then he shut the door of the office in their faces
and consulted with the steward again.
</p>

<p>
"How many of the help will stay?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps half, sir.  Some of the guests' private
servants&mdash;the maids and valets&mdash;have gone already
with the others on that train.  There are drafts
being made on George and me for some of the
maids and waiters&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cut that off.  Refuse everybody," advised
Ryder.  "These people will have to get along
without such personal service for the present.  They
should know that without explanation.  You need
every man and woman you've got on your roster,
don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, I don't see how we shall get along
at all with so few in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"So I thought.  Now, follow out my instructions
to the letter in the matter of the placing of
the oil lamps.  Send the porters around through
the corridors to screw up the brackets for the
bracket lamps.  There are more than four dozen
of those.  We'll decide about the stoves later.  It is
not getting very cold out of doors, and nobody will
suffer much before bedtime."
</p>

<p>
He left the steward's room and went back to the
office, ignoring the men who stood about and looked
at him as though he were a dog in a strange town.
As he walked down the long corridor and came in
sight of the stairway he observed Ruth standing at
the foot of the flight.  Half the men in the foyer
had turned to look at her, and Ryder saw her color
and shrink toward the curtained entrance of the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
Ryder did not wonder that the other guests stared
at her.  This did not fan any foolish jealousy into
flame.  It was because she was so very, very beautiful
that she attracted attention.
</p>

<p>
If she had been attractive in the traveling dress
she had worn at dinner, this gray and pink costume
enhanced her beauty marvelously.
</p>

<p>
The wonder of it smote Ryder again.  How came
his wife by such gowns?  When did she get them?
What did it mean?
</p>

<p>
And then something occurred to draw his mind
from this thought.  He saw Ruth whisper to a
passing bellboy and then she disappeared into the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
Ryder walked slowly forward expecting the boy
would come directly to him.  But to his amazement
the messenger did not glance in his direction.
Instead the boy approached a group in one corner and
Ryder saw that the man calling himself "John
B. White" was a member of that group.
</p>

<p>
The bellboy said something.  Ryder was watching
White's face.  He saw the man pale, then color,
and with quick steps he crossed the foyer and
entered the dining-room as though directly in answer
to the summons from Mrs. Ryder!
</p>

<p>
The half-stunned bridegroom caught at the sleeve
of the bellboy as he came back.
</p>

<p>
"See here!" he whispered, fiercely, in the ear of
the startled messenger, "who did the lady send
for?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. White," was the answer of the boy, and
looked at Ryder in wonder.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
WITH THE WORLD SHUT OUT
</h3>

<p>
Ryder stopped dead in his tracks and let the boy
pass on.  His usually well ordered mind was a
chaos.
</p>

<p>
To see Ruth deliberately send for that man whom
she had declared she did not know, and seemingly
make an engagement to meet him in the hotel
dining-room!  Well! it was enough to make any
husband suspicious.
</p>

<p>
John Ryder's impulse was to follow swiftly after
White.  Had he done so, there would have been an
ugly scene in the dining-room of Pinewood Inn.
But the blaze of anger that immediately leaped up
within him, and would have choked his utterance
and perhaps made him disgrace himself, warned
Ryder that it would be the part of wisdom for him
to cool down before presenting himself in the
dining-room.
</p>

<p>
He swung on his heel and returned along the
corridor.  The café door was right before him.  He
was not a drinking man&mdash;that is, one who made a
practice of patronizing a bar, or drinking other
than at his meals; but the swinging door of the
hotel café invited him, and he felt that if ever in his
life he wanted a drink it was now.
</p>

<p>
The bar had been well patronized all the evening,
the trade keeping the two white jacketed men behind
it on the jump.  Here was the storm center of
the indignant outburst against the hotel management,
and Colonel Brack's frequent visits to the bar
had increased his fluency and fanned the fires of
his rage against what he loudly termed "this beastly
imposition, suh!"
</p>

<p>
He was calling it this and harder things when
Ryder entered.  The latter slipped quietly up to
the bar, told the man what he wanted, and waited
to sip the appetizer without giving the least
attention to the other patrons.  But his appearance did
not pass unmarked.  There were plenty of trouble
breeders ready to call the colonel's attention to
Ryder's presence.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a roar at the end of the bar
and the colonel, crying, "Lemme at him!  Lemme
see him!" charged down the line, brushing the men
along the rail away like flies.
</p>

<p>
The crowd cleared the way instantly, leaving the
space open between the wrathful old campaigner
and the man quietly sipping his sherry and bitters.
Perhaps the suspicion that the colonel was in the
habit of "going heeled" made the shrinkage of the
men hanging on the bar-rail so unanimous.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Brack, afflicted with an artificial limb,
was not possessed of that grace of movement necessary
to make a man a personable figure in leading
a cotillion; but he was getting over the floor with
mighty strides until he suddenly awoke to the fact
that none of his friends was restraining him.
</p>

<p>
Not a single man in the group of his adherents
laid hold on his coat-tails or tried to soothe and
pacify the doughty warrior, while Ryder stood
coolly sipping his drink.
</p>

<p>
It was an embarrassing moment.  The colonel
halted midway in his flight and glanced hastily
about; but nobody came tardily to his aid.  They
all plainly considered that John Ryder deserved all
that was coming to him&mdash;and they were willing in
this case to let the colonel go ahead.
</p>

<p>
Ryder meanwhile watched the colonel curiously,
but made no move to guard himself from the threatened
attack.  For fourteen years Colonel Brack had
been a picturesque figure in the café of Pinewood
Inn.  It was whispered among those whom the
colonel had taken into his confidence at odd and
various times, that he had in the West a reputation
for being "a bad man to stir up, suh!"
</p>

<p>
Usually he played his cards so well that he was
"saved by his friends" when upon the verge of
doing something rash.  In this case everybody was
willing to see John Ryder get all that the colonel
threatened him with.  And it suddenly smote the
old fire-eater, and smote him hard, that he had
"overplayed his hand."
</p>

<p>
The crowd had rapidly got out of his way, and
he had all the room he needed for either fisticuffs
or guns.  Ryder finished his sherry, and placed the
glass softly on the bar.  His movements were as
deliberate as the colonel's had been impetuous.  The
latter finally found his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Suh! my contempt for you, and the interference
of my friends here, are all that save you from
the punishment you deserve, suh!  Crippled as I
am, honorably and in my country's cause" (it was
not generally known that Colonel Brack had lost
his leg in a premature explosion in the Leading
Sinner Mine, from which still-paying proposition
he drew his small income), "and old as I am,
nothing less would keep me from laying violent hands
upon you, suh!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder turned away from the bar and, as he did
so, he snapped his fingers under the colonel's
glowing nose.
</p>

<p>
"Cut it short, Colonel, I'm busy," he said.
"Haven't you anything else to say to me?  No?
Then&mdash;good-night!" and he walked out of the café.
</p>

<p>
It was a cruel blow to the colonel's popularity.
The crowd began to snicker, and the snicker grew
to a loud and general laugh.  Colonel Brack's
prestige as a "bad man" melted, and was gone at the
Pinewood Inn bar forever.
</p>

<p>
Ryder, perhaps somewhat relieved of his ill temper,
it having found a vent in this incident, walked
directly to the dining-room.  He glanced about
for White but did not see him.  Was the man still
with Mrs. Ryder?
</p>

<p>
The moment had perhaps arrived for the mystery
to be explained.  The thought made him secretly
tremble.  It is facing the unknown that makes
cowards of us all.
</p>

<p>
But John Ryder's countenance did not betray
his inward feelings.  He walked into the dining-room
in his usual, dignified manner.  Everything
was rose-tinted from the shaded lamps on each
table.  He almost instantly saw his wife sitting at
a cozy table, and with her was Mrs. Judson.
</p>

<p>
White was not in sight.  There were perhaps two
dozen little parties sprinkled about; but with none
of them was the individual who had earned so
much of John Ryder's attention.
</p>

<p>
Ryder, appearing much calmer than he really
was, approached his wife and her companion.  Ruth
seemed undisturbed save that her face was a trifle
paler than it had been.  But it lit up with pleasure
and her eyes shone when she saw Ryder coming.
</p>

<p>
And this look staggered the man.  There was
nothing furtive&mdash;nothing secretive&mdash;in Ruth's
manner.  It was disgraceful to think of her having
some secret from him when her beautiful face
beamed such love and happiness at his approach.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a fool&mdash;a cad&mdash;a scoundrel!" he told himself
savagely.  "I ought to tell her what is troubling
me right now and have the matter explained.
Confound this old busybody, anyway!"
</p>

<p>
But he managed to hide his dislike for the widow
as he sat down.
</p>

<p>
"Really, your wife looked so lonely, that I had
to come over and talk with her," cried the vivacious
Mrs. Judson, shaking her lorgnette at Ryder.  "You
shameful men&mdash;going off by yourselves&mdash;herding
together socially&mdash;and in that vulgar café, I'll be
bound!  I declare! the ordinary man wouldn't give
up his nightcap even on his wedding night.  Fie!
For shame!"
</p>

<p>
Ruth blushed faintly, and looked at Ryder
apologetically.  The latter checked his real feelings and
displayed an emotionless face.  The widow rambled
on:
</p>

<p>
"I got into the habit of taking a late bite with
poor dear Horace.  He always liked it.  And
to-night when we were all so upset I knew I couldn't
sleep without it.  I really get so lonely&mdash;living alone
and eating alone&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
What could Ryder do?  He looked at Ruth.  She
made a little <i>moue</i> with her pretty lips and shrugged
her shoulders slightly.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be glad to have you take supper with
us, Mrs. Judson," Ryder said, telling the lie with
an expressionless face.
</p>

<p>
"Now, isn't that too, too sweet of you?" gushed
the widow.  "And when I know you must be just
longing to be tête-à-tête&mdash;both of you.  Now, don't
deny it!"
</p>

<p>
Their faces did not, if their murmurs belied their
expression of countenance.  But Mrs. Judson ran
on untiringly&mdash;she was a "fluid" speaker&mdash;and
settled herself more comfortably in her chair.
Evidently Ryder had her on his hands, and he beckoned
the waiter so as to have it over with as soon as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Ruth had said she was hungry, and Mrs. Judson
looked like a woman with a hearty appetite.  Her
order did not belie her appearance.  Ryder was
too much disturbed in his mind to know whether he
could eat or not; but he ordered something, and
tried to be social while a dozen different threads of
thought were entangled in his brain.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's so romantic, don't you know, for you
two to get married and come right here when the
hotel is so disrupted," gushed the widow.
</p>

<p>
"Very romantic," acquiesced Ryder grimly.
</p>

<p>
"You two poor babes in the woods.  No!  I'm
going to call you Romeo and Juliet," she declared.
"I'm sure the opportunity for your husband to be
a romantic knight," looking at Ruth, "is just as
good in this hotel under present conditions as he
would have found in the days of the Montagues and
Capulets.
</p>

<p>
"He has surely rescued one lone dame in distress&mdash;that's
me!" and she laughed with a heartiness that
shook her ponderous figure.  "There are dragons
to kill now, too.  I understand that one man here in
the hotel has bought up all the lamps and candles
in town and refuses to let us have any save at an
exorbitant price."
</p>

<p>
"How mean!" murmured Ruth, trying to be
polite while Ryder smiled behind his napkin.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it?  I mean to get back to my rooms so
that Marie can undress me before the lights are
put out.  I don't know what I would do in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"I think it is horrid of anybody to take advantage
of our necessities in such a way as this," Ruth said
thoughtfully.  "Fancy being at the mercy of a
man who would be mean enough to corner the lighting
of the world&mdash;and if he'd corner the lighting of
a single hotel I suppose he would a deal rather
found a Universal Lighting Trust."
</p>

<p>
The little joke which he was having all to
himself put Ryder in a better humor.  Mrs. Judson
grew more animated, and Ruth did her best to
make the impromptu occasion pleasant.
</p>

<p>
"Just think! this is a bridal supper," simpered
Mrs. Judson.  "We ought to celebrate&mdash;just a
little.  It's wicked, I know, to think of champagne at
such a time.  But we must have something
more sparkling than water to drink this pretty
lady's health in.  If you will allow me,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Romeo&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I could not think of your ordering anything at
my table," said Ryder with an involuntary frown.
"But if you ladies would enjoy a glass of wine we
will have some, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Now, that is gallant of you," cried the widow,
forseeing a luxury that she loved, but seldom paid
for.  "When poor dear Horace was alive we had
it often for dinner.  He was inordinately fond of
the good things of life."
</p>

<p>
"But his taste in wives was not very select,"
thought John Ryder, his disgust growing.
</p>

<p>
Ruth had crimsoned, but her signal to Ryder to
order no wine was unheeded.  To tell the truth he
was a little piqued.  It was Ruth's fault that they
were in this situation.  She had made friends first
with Mrs. Judson.
</p>

<p>
But when the waiter brought the bucket of ice
in which nestled a quart bottle, the very
atmosphere about their table seemed to be enlivened.
The widow's dusky cheek soon glowed, her eyes
sparkled, and her vivacity seemed to increase with
the good things placed before her.
</p>

<p>
Ryder noted, too, that Ruth's eyes held in their
depths a sparkle&mdash;a point of fire&mdash;that had not
been there before.  And those eyes, brilliant at one
moment and the next swimming as though in unshed
tears, rested upon his countenance most of the
time.  Her smile was for him.  She played the
hostess prettily; but her attention, after all, was
for her husband, and the color came and went in
her cheeks in a manner most charming.
</p>

<p>
She was a woman in love&mdash;in love with the man
she had married&mdash;with every thought of her soul
and every fibre of her being.
</p>

<p>
A realization of this fact swept from the chambers
of her husband's mind every atom of suspicion.
No woman could look at a man as Ruth looked at
him and withhold in her secret heart any mystery
that might bring shame upon him or disaster to
herself.
</p>

<p>
"Romeo, you are a lucky man," whispered the
widow, tapping him on the arm with the expressive
lorgnette and leaning forward to put her full, red
lips close to his ear, but with her laughing eyes on
Ruth's face to see how the bride took another
woman's familiarity with her husband.  "She loves
you as one woman in a thousand ever loves her husband."
</p>

<p>
"I am a lucky man," repeated Ryder, though
more to himself than to the cynical widow.
</p>

<p>
The latter shook a playful&mdash;and diamond
bedewed&mdash;finger at Ruth.  "You are giving him a
great advantage, Juliet.  Let a man once realize that
you love him so devotedly, and he'll ride rough shod
over your heart.  It's always the way," and she
sighed heavily&mdash;"though," thought John Ryder,
"the sigh may be caused more by the supper she has
eaten than by any sentimental emotion."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Juliet," rambled on the wined, and consequently
quite happy, Mrs. Judson, "take the advice
of a woman of experience, and do not give your
heart too completely into any man's keeping.  I am
not old&mdash;oh, no! for we women who live and love
do not grow old&mdash;but I have lived more years than
have you, sweet girl, and I have loved&mdash;and been
loved," she simpered, "and I tell you it is always
better to keep the driving hand."
</p>

<p>
Ruth shivered in disgust.  Ryder kept a stony
face and began to eat the meal before him, which
before he had scarcely touched.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that woman over there?" suddenly
questioned Mrs. Judson.  "They say she is the most
abominable&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mrs. Judson," and this time Ruth spoke
with decision, "in time we shall learn to know our
fellow guests perhaps.  Tonight let us talk about
things&mdash;not people;" and with a power rare in so
young and inexperienced a person, she kept the talk
from again wandering to personalities or to
sentimentalities.
</p>

<p>
Ryder ignored the suggestion of any more wine,
and the widow finally bethought her of the fact that
the lights might go out soon and leave her in the
dark.  So the little supper party broke up.
</p>

<p>
Almost everybody else had left the room save a
young woman whom Ryder had noticed before&mdash;a
plainly dressed, freckled, sharp-featured girl, who
ate alone at a table near the door.  That is, she was
supposed to eat; but in reality she read most
diligently a rather dingy paper covered pamphlet that
was folded into small compass beside her plate.
</p>

<p>
As Ryder and his party passed out he saw the
girl devouring the story she was reading with a
mouthful from her plate poised on her fork.  So
eager was she over the book, and so excited, that
she gestured with this mouthful, jabbing the fork
to and fro as though duelling with an imaginary
enemy and feeling within herself, without doubt,
all the emotions of the characters in the fiction she
was perusing.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Judson, now in a very happy state, indented
Ryder's ribs with an irritating thumb, and
whispered shrilly: "Do you know who she is?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the pleasure of the young lady's
acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
"She's the house detective," giggled the heavy
lady.  "Isn't she funny?  She's reading a five-cent
detective thriller.  She gave me a pile of them to
read once.  She says&mdash;he, he!&mdash;they feed the
imagination."
</p>

<p>
Ryder looked back at the plain-featured girl.  She
was still waving the mouthful on her fork, wrapped
in her novel, as he and the two women of his party
went on to the elevator.  He left Ruth and
Mrs. Judson to go up in that while he went for a final
conference with George and the steward before
retiring himself.  The porters had fixed the bracket
lamps in the main corridors of the hotel (and there
were none too many) while one was at the clerk's
desk and was already lighted.
</p>

<p>
"Back to the days of our grandfathers," said
George, grinning.  "'The light of other
days.'  Say! some of these fellows, Mr. Ryder, are
frothing at the mouth about you."
</p>

<p>
"I thought Colonel Brack&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not him.  The old boy's been taken off to his
own room by his wife.  That lady is of the salt of
the earth, and she knows just how to handle
Aurelius.  She's been handling him for a good many
years.  He's nowhere near such a 'howling wolf'
in his own coral as he appears outside.
</p>

<p>
"But some of the others&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He halted, for Jimson, the man with the invalid
wife, suddenly appeared in a glow of indignation,
and George let him speak for himself.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Mr. Ryder," he sputtered, "I am
not challenging your right to make money out of
our necessity&mdash;that seems to be your business,"
and he sneered so that it must have hurt him.  "But
at least you should have some humanity&mdash;some
bowels of compassion.  My wife is ill and almost
helpless; the last time I was up there the rooms were
already becoming chilled because of the decreased
steam pressure.
</p>

<p>
"You positively must let me have one of those
stoves Al has there in the storeroom.  I don't care
what you want for it.  I'll pay.  I <i>must</i> have one."
</p>

<p>
"They are not for sale, Mr. Jimson," Ryder
responded coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ryder, this is outrageous!  I will give you
ten dollars for one of those stoves."
</p>

<p>
"That would be only about fifty per cent. profit
on the large stoves, Mr. Jimson.  Do you think you
would care to do that if you were in my place?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'll give you twenty&mdash;fifty dollars, then,"
Jimson blurted out.
</p>

<p>
Here George interfered.  The clerk seemed
really put out with little Jimson.
</p>

<p>
"You should take a walk around and cool off,
Mr. Jimson&mdash;and Colonel Brack, too.  Some of you
have been insulting Mr. Ryder for two hours, and
jawing your heads off about what he's done.  And
you don't <i>know</i> what he's done."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" bristled Jimson, yet puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"He has done what none of the rest of you had
public spirit enough to do," went on the hotel clerk.
"If anybody pays him for what he has laid out for
the comfort of the guests of this hotel it will be the
Barnaby estate, when this trouble is finally
straightened out.  Five minutes ago, Mr. Jimson,
Mr. Ryder had one of the largest oil heaters he bought
and a nice reading lamp sent up to your wife."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by Jove!  I&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;  I didn't understand&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jimson's words rambled off into a stammering
monologue.  Ryder had handed George back
the list he had been looking over.  "That will be
about all, I guess," he said.  "I'm going to turn in.
Good-night!" and ignoring the apologizing Jimson
he made for the stairway.
</p>

<p>
The dining-room was closed.  The last elevator
boy came out of his cage and locked the door.  The
hands of the clock in the foyer lacked but a few
minutes of midnight.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the clerk from his station at
the desk.  "The dynamos will run but ten minutes
longer.  The café is closed for the night.  I advise
you to go to your rooms."
</p>

<p>
The sharp-faced girl whom Ryder had noticed in
the dining-room had taken up her station near the
foot of the stairs.  She had the folded paper novel
in her hand.  She looked particularly wideawake,
and the literary pabulem she so enjoyed might
indeed spur her imagination.  She was evidently on
duty for the night.
</p>

<p>
"Gad!" exclaimed one man.  "We might as well
be stopping at a Mills' Hotel.  They send you to
bed with the chickens," and with laughter and jest
the company slowly broke up.
</p>

<p>
The telephone buzzed at the clerk's elbow.  He
took down the receiver, listened a moment, and then
spoke to the house detective:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Solomons, you're wanted in Parlor A."
</p>

<p>
Ryder, in serious mood, was already climbing
the stairs.  The young woman passed him like a
shot, and still he was not aroused from his reverie.
He was tired.  His work for the comfort of the
hotel guests was done, and he uttered a sigh of
satisfaction at the thought.  There was positively
nothing else that could happen to balk his desire
to be alone with his wife.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE BEGINNING OF A NIGHTMARE
</h3>

<p>
Coming to Parlor A on his way to his apartment,
Ryder saw lights and heard a buzz of excited voices.
He saw the house detective, and stopped a moment
to see what had brought her here in such haste.
</p>

<p>
Drawn into a corner at the end of the room near
the huge picture of "The Cheesemonger" was an
invalid's chair, which the colored man, James, had
evidently just made up as a bed for his crotchety
master.  And there was old Cudger, in a blanket
robe, nightcap, and carpet slippers, wrathfully
facing three women who, so Ryder thought, should
have long since been in bed.
</p>

<p>
Eying both parties stood the sharp-featured Miss
Solomons, her novel in one hand, the other on her
hip and her head on one side.  The chatter of the
women, the grumbling of Cudger, and the chuckling
of James, who seemed to find much amusement in
the situation, made little impression upon the
phenomenal calm of the house detective.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then!" the latter said at last, "let's get
this thing straight.  Mr. Cudger has permission
to sleep here to watch his oil painting tonight.
What are you ladies doin' here?  Lights'll go out
in two minutes anyway."
</p>

<p>
"It is disgraceful!" ejaculated one woman, a
hard-featured person with glasses and a "transformation"
that did not match her back hair in color.
"This man coming into the ladies' parlor in his
nightclothes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Don't expect me to sleep in my day clothes,
do you?" snapped Mr. Cudger.
</p>

<p>
"What are you ladies here for?" reiterated the
sharp voice of Miss Solomons.  "I ask you."
</p>

<p>
"We were holding a committee meeting&mdash;a very
important meeting," said the hard-featured one.
"You know very well, young woman, that the
Society for the Betterment of the Condition of
Delinquent Girls will hold their convention here
next week.  We are the advance committee of the
S.B.C.D.G.
</p>

<p>
"All right," interrupted Miss Solomons.  "But
you had better advance right to bed, ladies.  Lights
out in one minute.  Talk it over in the morning.
Mr. Cudger has the call on this parlor tonight."
</p>

<p>
"But I tell you, young woman, we have a right
to hold our meeting here, no matter what the time
is," cried the militant lady.
</p>

<p>
"In the dark?" exclaimed the house detective.
"No, ma'am!" and she advanced upon the three
much as she might have upon a flock of chickens,
literally shooing them out of the parlor.
</p>

<p>
But once in the hall the women stopped to parley
some more.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Solomons, this is a perfect outrage&mdash;an
outrage not to be permitted in a well-ordered house,
such as the Pinewood Inn is supposed to be,"
stormed the hard-featured woman, and there was
the ring of war in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mrs. Dent," put in the oily voice of a
large brawny woman, another of the three ejected
committee women, "Miss Solomons is not to blame.
Miss Solomons, no doubt, is deeply interested in
our work"&mdash;Miss Solomons sniffed and the woman
with the "transformation" glared angrily at the
house detective&mdash;"but this awful Bangs&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Solomons is to blame!" interrupted
Mrs. Dent, in a hard, decisive tone.  "If she had the
judgment of a kitten&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, see here, ladies!" flared out the house
detective, "we're not a-goin' to have any meanderings
around the hallways in the dark this night.  There
go the lights now.  You go, and go now!"
</p>

<p>
The women scuttled away without further words,
and Miss Solomons disappeared in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
John Ryder, vastly amused, changed his opinion
then and there regarding the appointment of a
woman for such a position as Miss Solomons held.
No man could have handled this situation with such
vigor and promptness.
</p>

<p>
A smile wreathed his lips as he went on to his
own door.  Along the corridor before him, now
illumined only by an occasional bracket lamp, he saw
flitting the lighted candles of the other late guests
seeking their beds.
</p>

<p>
Ryder opened the door of his suite expecting to
see a picture similar to the one he had observed
when he had come to the room before supper.  But,
although the lamp he had sent up was burning on
the reading table, Ruth was not present.  The room
was empty and the atmosphere of it seemed chill
as he stepped in.
</p>

<p>
Nor was there a light in the inner room.  He
did not hear a sound.  Where had his wife gone?
Was she with Mrs. Judson in that lady's rooms?
And where were they?
</p>

<p>
Ryder was suddenly disgusted again.  For
heaven's sake! couldn't Ruth break away from that
woman?  And after the experience they had had
with her at the supper table, too!
</p>

<p>
He had heard certain of his married acquaintances
occasionally curse the interference of some
"woman friend" in the otherwise quiet pool of
their domesticity.  Was he going to butt up against
something like that at the very start?  It could not
be possible that Ruth was enamored of the society
of such a woman as the vulgar Mrs. Judson!
</p>

<p>
He turned up the wick of the lamp and strode
with it to the door of the bedroom, flinging back
the hangings.  Instantly the light flooded the chamber,
and a prettily disheveled figure started up out
of a nest of pillows.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I was napping!" she cried with a tremulous
little laugh.  "What a bad girl I am!  You were
so long, Johnny, and I was so sleepy.  It must
be very late."
</p>

<p>
She had made ready for the night.  Her beautiful
hair was in two thick plaits over her shoulders&mdash;those
shoulders so white and soft and beautifully
curved betrayed by the cut of her nightgown and
the lacy negligee she had thrown over it.
</p>

<p>
As she slipped out of bed he saw her slim bare
ankles, her feet thrust into swansdown slippers.
They were like a child's.  She seemed more childish
and appealing to him than she had before.  Ryder
felt momentary shame again that he should have
been impatient.
</p>

<p>
"It is late," he admitted.  "I am afraid, Ruth,
you have had a very tiresome evening.  This hasn't
been just the sort of a beginning to our married life
that we might wish."
</p>

<p>
She laughed merrily.  "I guess neither of us
imagined a honeymoon like this, dear.  I used to
try to think what you would be like after all these
years&mdash;and you were so far away, too, John.  It&mdash;it
was like a dream&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Ryder had stepped back to replace the lamp upon
the table.  He almost dropped it.  What was she
saying?  But before he could find his voice or
move from the spot where surprise had frozen
him, the door which he had failed to lock burst in
and Mrs. Judson, in a state of mind&mdash;and of
dishabille&mdash;that completely shocked John Ryder,
entered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p129"></a>
A large woman in bedroom wrapper and tears
is not a fetching sight.  And when she came down
the room like a cyclone and flung herself with
abandon into his arms, he&mdash;well, John Ryder
swore!
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-129"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-129.jpg" alt="Flung herself with abandon into John Ryder's arms">
<br>
Flung herself with abandon into John Ryder's arms
</p>

<p>
Not loud, but deep and with a fervency that
could not be mistaken.  She came within an ace
of toppling him over, and he dragged her to the
couch and dropped her there&mdash;the springs creaking
a pained objection to her sudden weight.
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens above!" grumbled the exasperated
Ryder.  "What's the matter with the creature
now?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what is it?" asked Ruth from the chamber,
and he heard the patter of her slippered feet as she
ran to the door.
</p>

<p>
"It's your friend, Mrs. Judson," said the harassed
bridegroom with disgust.  "She's come in here to
have a fit&mdash;or something."  Then to himself he
added: "Why in hades didn't I lock that door?
But she'd have busted it in and come right through.
Talk about a honeymoon!  Ye gods! was ever a
man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here he was startled by Mrs. Judson's hysterical
acrobatics.  She was gasping and crying and laughing,
all at once.  Her state was plainly volcanic.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce is to be done with her?" he
demanded of his wife.
</p>

<p>
Ruth brushed him aside and took charge of the
patient, whom he had been trying to hold down
upon the cushions by main force.
</p>

<p>
"The ammonia bottle&mdash;on the bureau in
there&mdash;quick!" Ruth commanded, and Ryder ran to obey
like a lamb.
</p>

<p>
Ruth thrust the unstoppered bottle under
Mrs. Judson's nose.  The ammonia almost choked Ryder
when he got a whiff of it; and it brought the widow
up standing and trying to catch her breath.  She
had been by no means unconscious, and it flashed
through John Ryder's brain that she might have
heard what he said about her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Judson choked for a moment, sputtered,
uttered a stifled shriek or two, and then fell to
crying more quietly, but rocking herself to and
fro on the couch and wringing her bejeweled hands.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm hanged!" muttered Ryder.  "This is
pretty near the limit!"
</p>

<p>
Ruth turned to look at him for a moment.  Her
eyes suddenly sparkled with merriment and she
shook a playful finger at him.
</p>

<p>
"You're like other men, I see," she whispered.
"I guess I'm glad.  I began to think you were
almost an angel, hubby."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Judson monopolized her attention then.  She
began to pour out a tale of woe that Ryder could
scarcely understand; but it seemed Marie had left
her&mdash;had run away while she was at supper&mdash;and
had gone with some of the hotel help in a wagon
back into the country where there was a station on
another railroad&mdash;a long and toilsome journey, but
anything to get away from a hotel that had no heat
or electric lights!
</p>

<p>
"And she's robbed me&mdash;I know she has!  Of
course she has!  Don't you say she hasn't!" chattered
the large lady, her bosom heaving, threatening
to go into another convulsion.  "Send for Miss
Solomons.  She must find my brooches&mdash;my
rings&mdash;my necklace&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who is Miss Solomons?" asked Ruth wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"The house detective," said Ryder, and was very
glad thereafter that he said no more, for a cold
voice at the open door of the suite said clearly:
</p>

<p>
"What's going on here?  Who wants Miss
Solomons?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Judson had gone waveringly on to another
phase of her trouble.  "And I tried to undress
myself; but I didn't dare go to bed.  And then the
lights went out and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She trailed off again into spasmodic cries.  Miss
Solomons marched down the room to where the
bridegroom and his bride were endeavoring to
pacify the large lady.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" sniffed the house detective, high disgust
expressed upon her keen face.  "It's that Judson
woman.  What's the matter with her now?"
</p>

<p>
The question, Ryder thought, was to the point.
At that moment Mrs. Judson's gyrations reminded
him of those of an eel upon a hot frying pan.
Personally he was becoming frightened.
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't she have a doctor?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"A barrel stave would do her more good,"
declared Miss Solomons harshly.
</p>

<p>
"If I had a little aromatic spirits I'd fix her!"
exclaimed Ruth, biting her lower lip either to stifle
a desire to laugh or to cry, Ryder could not tell
which.
</p>

<p>
"Doctor!" sniffed the house detective, glaring
at the hysterical woman.
</p>

<p>
But Ryder rushed to the telephone and called the
office.  George answered at once.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Judson is ill&mdash;here in our rooms," Ryder
said.  "Isn't there a doctor in the neighborhood?"
</p>

<p>
"There's one in the house.  I'll send Dr. Hoyle
right up, Mr. Ryder," said the clerk.
</p>

<p>
"Hoyle won't thank you for troubling him," Miss
Solomons sneered.  But as Mrs. Judson began on
another spasm she did not leave Ruth all the work
of holding the large lady upon the couch.
</p>

<p>
"My soul! this is awful!" groaned Ryder, coming
back just as Mrs. Judson began another series
of convulsions, for which indulgence in public she
was not dressed exactly right.
</p>

<p>
"Say!" exclaimed the house detective to Ryder.
"This is no place for a man.  You had better go."
</p>

<p>
"Hang it!" groaned Ryder, realizing that Miss
Solomons was right, and starting for the door
again.  "Why couldn't she have gone somewhere
else to have her fit?"
</p>

<p>
Just then the doctor's welcome knock sounded.
Ryder let him in.  The medical man appeared,
candle in one hand and his black case in the other.
The ridiculousness of walking about this big hotel
carrying a candle stuck into the neck of a whisky
bottle did not appear to strike any of them at the
moment as humorous.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hoyle was a young but very businesslike
practitioner.  He handed his candle to Ryder, strode
down the room, and sat down beside the widow,
one end of whom each of the other women was
trying to hold to the couch.
</p>

<p>
"Half a glass of water, please," he said to Ruth.
"Let her go, Miss Solomons.  She isn't going to
kick any more now."
</p>

<p>
"Gee!" gasped the house detective, getting up
from her knees and striking her usual attitude, one
hand on her hip and the other clutching the paper
novel.
</p>

<p>
The doctor selected a vial from his case, dropped
a little of its contents into the water, which
instantly turned the water cloudy and white; then
held the glass to the patient's lips.
</p>

<p>
"Drink this," he commanded.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Judson's jaws seemed to be locked and her
eyes were tightly closed.  She breathed stertorously.
Ryder, looking on from afar, was actually frightened.
If that woman dared to die in this room&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Drink this, Mrs. Judson!" said the doctor again.
</p>

<p>
No result.  Then the professional man leaned
forward, with the glass still at her lips, and, seizing
the large lady's nose, deliberately wrung it!  The
seemingly fixed jaws unlocked instantly and
Mrs. Judson uttered an entirely different cry from her
former painful sounds.
</p>

<p>
"Gee!" sighed Miss Solomons again, but with
satisfaction.  "This is no place for us, Mister.
Come on!  Dr. Hoyle can manage her without our
help," and she started for the door.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES
</h3>

<p>
"Drink this!" the doctor said again to the large
lady, and, choking and sputtering, Mrs. Judson did
as she was told.  Ryder looked on in amazement.
Ruth, seeing his face, and Miss Solomon's back
being turned, broke into a giggle and cast herself
helplessly into Ryder's arms.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! you funny, funny man!" she murmured.
"I like to see a doctor work over a woman with
hysterics&mdash;they know 'em so well!"
</p>

<p>
The house detective stalked out, leaving the door
of the suite open.  Ryder did not know whether
to follow her or remain.  Mrs. Judson was evidently
determined not to give up the role of patient too
easily.  She caught the hand that had so cruelly
wrung her nose and begged the doctor not to leave
her.
</p>

<p>
He said he would not&mdash;in that sympathetically
disgusted tone that medical men use on such occasions.
He felt himself in a foolish position, and
another man was looking on.
</p>

<p>
"Your husband, Madam?" he asked Ruth shortly,
nodding toward Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said with a blush.
</p>

<p>
"Better ask him to retire while we get Mrs. Judson
to bed.  She has had these attacks before.
She will not be over this one in a hurry."  Then he
added in a lower tone: "What's the matter now?
Is her lapdog sick?"
</p>

<p>
"Her maid has left her," Ruth said, having hard
work, as Ryder saw, to keep from laughing.  But
he felt no desire to laugh himself.  Undress that
woman and put her to bed <i>here</i>?  John Ryder was
getting desperate.  This nightmare of untoward
incidents was altogether too much for his self-control.
</p>

<p>
"That's a serious matter," grunted the doctor.
"Neither of us will get much rest tonight if
Mrs. Judson follows her usual course.  Perhaps you
can get somebody to help you, Madam&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am used to nursing sick people," Ruth told him
demurely.  "I can follow your instructions exactly,
Doctor.  In fact, I have had considerable experience
in nursing.  In the present state of the hotel's
affairs it might be difficult to get a maid."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that is so," the medical man admitted.
"Well, the first thing to do is to get her into bed."
</p>

<p>
Ryder, who felt that he never, on short acquaintance,
had so disliked a man as he did this physician,
had edged off to the further end of the room.  Ruth
came to him, still with laughter expressed in her
quivering face and voice.
</p>

<p>
"You are only a 'mere man'&mdash;you cannot stay
here, hubby," she whispered, putting her lips up to
his.  "You will have to go out until we get
Mrs. Judson into my bed.  Then&mdash;if she gets quiet&mdash;you
may come back.  I will sit up to tend to her and you
can nap on the couch.  But don't go too far
away."
</p>

<p>
"Why, hang it, Ruth!" he complained, not at all
the business man now, "can't she be lugged back
to her own room?"
</p>

<p>
"But that would be cruel.  She was frightened
there, because she was alone and the lights went out.
<i>I</i> should have to go with her, you know.  Come
now! be knightly, Mr. Romeo," she added, her
voice trailing off into a laugh as she pushed him
gently out of the room.
</p>

<p>
John Ryder walked away about ten steps.  Then
he stopped, and smote one clenched fist into his
other open palm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am hanged!" he ejaculated, and with
fervor, "Some honeymoon!  What?
</p>

<p>
"For a man to be turned out of his rooms at this
hour of the night, and for a confounded, silly,
hysterical old woman!  Bah!"
</p>

<p>
John Ryder drew out a cigar, bit off the end
savagely and lit it in direct contradiction to hotel
rules, and puffed away like a donkey engine while
he paced the carpeted corridor.
</p>

<p>
He was no longer the man with the welfare of his
fellow guests at heart&mdash;particularly of the women
and children in Pinewood Inn.  He was tired, he
was sleepy, and he had had enough excitement to
last him for some time to come.
</p>

<p>
The procession of incidents which had enlivened
his existence since the <i>Minnequago</i> had docked
were flung upon the screen of his memory again,
and he reviewed them like a spectator at a moving
picture show.
</p>

<p>
He remembered in what a nervous state he
awaited the steamship's docking, expecting some
word from the beautiful girl whom he had learned
to love during the passage across the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
Having not seen her to speak to for some hours,
he had half feared to have her accept his proposal,
now that he had made it.  But the instant he saw
her on the wharf awaiting his coming, he had flung
all such hesitation and uncertainty to the winds.
She seemed in her appearance all that was good and
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Then followed in swift succession the obtaining
of the license, his own jumbled business at his
offices, the drive to the minister's, the marriage
ceremony, their hurried departure by train, their
arrival at the Pinewood Inn in safety despite the
accident at the bridge, their cozy little dinner, and
then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
In more somber colors followed the chain of
circumstances which had finally culminated in his
present plight.  Was ever a bridegroom up against
such confounded luck?
</p>

<p>
Some honeymoon, indeed!
</p>

<p>
He tried to laugh; but his position was too serious,
and his laugh was choked off by the time it was
started.  He swore softly again and paced on down
the hallway.  Coming to the door of the parlor, he
looked in.
</p>

<p>
Old Cudger was asleep in the invalid's chair
with a rug thrown over him.  Candles, in saucers
for sconces, burned before the picture, all other
lights in the room being extinguished.  Marching
up and down the rug like a sentinel with his
master's gold-headed cane upon his shoulder, was
James, the colored factotum of the owner of Van
Scamp's "Cheesemonger."
</p>

<p>
"It does look as though the hotel were in a state
of siege," muttered Ryder.  "It's an experience that
none of us will forget for many a long day.  Heigh
ho!  I wish I'd never come into the ranch," and
he stretched his arms above his head and yawned.
"This isn't my idea of a nice, quiet honeymoon."
</p>

<p>
At this end of the parlor the shadows were heavy.
But Ryder saw the outlines of several comfortable
looking chairs.  Plowing up and down the corridor
waiting for Ruth to call him back, began to pall
upon his mind.  He ventured into the big room.
</p>

<p>
His feet made no sound upon the rugs.  James
marched back and forth in perfect unconsciousness
of his presence.  Ryder made his way to a big,
sleepy-hollow chair, fumbled for the arms, found
them, and sank back restfully into&mdash;some other
person's lap!
</p>

<p>
It would be hard telling whether John Ryder or
the person in the easy chair, was the most startled.
The former leaped up with a surprised grunt.  The
other darted out of the chair and, before the man
could get more than a yard away, he felt the end
of a revolver thrust right against his waistline!
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!" hissed an excited voice.  "What you
doing here?  Trying to get fresh with me, or are
you just a ninny?"
</p>

<p>
John Ryder, had he not been for the moment
speechless, would certainly have owned to the final
accusation.  "Ninny" it was!  If he were not one,
he certainly would not be wandering about this
hotel instead of peaceably occupying the suite for
which he was paying thirty dollars a day.
</p>

<p>
"March out there under the lamp till I get a look
at you!  Quick now!" jerked out the person with
the weapon.
</p>

<p>
Ryder began to do as he was told&mdash;backward.
He could see the lighted end of the room.  James,
his face graying with fear, was squatting down behind
the invalid chair in which his sleeping master
reclined.  Evidently the row at the upper end of the
room had startled the negro more than it had the
two who were taking part in it.
</p>

<p>
Ryder's brusk antagonist jerked him swiftly
around into the corridor, under the nearest bracket
lamp.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh!" exclaimed Miss Solomons.  "So it's
you?  I've had my eye on you for some time.  What
you doing here, anyway?  And what you doin'
back there in those rooms where that Judson had a
fit?  You one of her friends?  What's your name?"
</p>

<p>
"I am Mr. Ryder," he told the house detective
mildly, noting that the paper novel was still clutched
fast in her left hand.
</p>

<p>
She grunted, tucking the revolver out of sight.
Evidently, whatever she suspected John Ryder of,
she did not consider him dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"Ryder, heh?" jerked out the house detective.
"Same one that beat 'em all to the lamps and
candles?  Not a crook, then.  Anyway, not a <i>little</i>
crook.  What you doin' in those rooms just now?"
she repeated.  "Mrs. Judson still there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Ryder said with vast disgust.  "They are
putting her to bed.  Turned me out."
</p>

<p>
"And why not?" snapped Miss Solomons.  "You
didn't expect to stay there all night, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" Ryder demanded with sudden vexation.
"I'm paying for them."
</p>

<p>
"That may be.  I don't doubt it," the house
detective said sharply.  "But we don't allow anything
like that here."
</p>

<p>
She gave Ryder a little shove toward the stairs,
and turned abruptly back into the parlor.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Je-eames!" he heard her drawl to the
colored man.  "No gun-play this time.  Come out
and do your goose-step up and down the rug.  And
if anybody else blunders in here while I'm napping,
keep 'em out of my lap, will you?"
</p>

<p>
To tell the truth John Ryder was so utterly
amazed that he could not reply to the house
detective.  He scarcely knew what she meant by her
innuendo; yet he felt rising anger.  She seemed to
have doubted the status of Ruth and himself as a
properly wedded pair!
</p>

<p>
Nightmare?  It was a saturnalia of misunderstanding
and vexing incidents!  John Ryder would
have been glad right then and there to take Ruth
and escape from the Pinewood Inn, even if they
had to walk through the night to some other shelter.
Later he wished with all his heart that he had
done just that.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
SOME EXPERIENCES OF A BRIDEGROOM
</h3>

<p>
John Ryder, just here, hearing voices and
laughter&mdash;even the clink of glasses&mdash;from the floor
below, felt a desire for human society&mdash;for speech with
sane people.  His mind was in such a chaotic
condition that he was not sure whether these recent
remarkable incidents had really happened to him,
or he had dreamed them.
</p>

<p>
He arrived at the top of the broad flight leading
down to the foyer.  There were candles glimmering
at the clerk's desk beside the bracket lamp, and
several of the guests were keeping George company.
Jimson was one; there were three men whom Ryder
had not before particularly noticed; and there was
White, the man of mystery.  The latter was sitting
rather sullenly with the others, sipping some
concoction in a tall glass&mdash;which, indeed, they were
all doing.
</p>

<p>
If for no other reason than to get a closer look
at John B. White, Ryder joined the party.  He was
welcomed vociferously by the clerk.  Jimson
considered it was up to him to pacify the man he had
so foolishly and impulsively insulted.
</p>

<p>
"Hope you'll let me mix you one, Mr. Ryder,"
Jimson said.  "Just to show there's no hard
feelings, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead," Ryder said, conscious that White
was watching him with clouded eyes.  Indeed, the
man seemed unable to keep his gaze off John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"How's Mrs. Judson?" asked George, with a
knowing grin.
</p>

<p>
"Confound her!" ejaculated the bridegroom.
"She's turned me out of house and home."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho!  And you a newly married man!"
cackled one of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"On his honeymoon," said Jimson.  Then he
blew a sigh.  "Well, it might be worse, Mr. Ryder.
You don't know what it is to have an invalid wife."
</p>

<p>
"Or a heavyweight, like the Lady Judson,"
chuckled another.
</p>

<p>
Ryder showed he was not deeply interested in
these witticisms.  George said rather lamely:
</p>

<p>
"Well, a man's got to make way for the ladies."
</p>

<p>
"Especially when they are hysterical," Jimson
added.  "I remember when my wife&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He started on a story that did not interest Ryder
in the least.  He was the host&mdash;it was his private
bottle they were sampling&mdash;so the clerk and all but
White and Ryder gave the narrator some attention.
</p>

<p>
White rose up suddenly and tapped John Ryder
on the shoulder.  "I beg your pardon, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;did
I catch your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Mr. Ryder!"  The man spoke rather gaspingly,
as though something interfered with his
breathing.  He gazed at Ryder with eyes that burned
strangely.  Altogether he did not seem in good
health, and again Ryder wondered if he was quite
right in his mind.  Perhaps ill health might explain
his odd actions, after all.
</p>

<p>
"I feel I owe you an apology&mdash;an explanation,"
said White, still in a low voice.  "Will&mdash;will you
come over here a moment&mdash;to this bench?  Give
me your attention briefly?"
</p>

<p>
"Guess I can," said Ryder.  "There seems nothing
much pressing on my time just now," he added
grimly, and followed White to the gloomier side
of the office where the two men seated themselves
on one of the leather-covered divans just under the
stairway.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said White, still in that stifled tone.
"I&mdash;I came down here expecting to intercept&mdash;that
is, to meet&mdash;er&mdash;friends.  I followed her down
here&mdash;&mdash;  Ahem!  Them, I mean; and I couldn't
find&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His voice trailed off into silence, while Ryder
watched him in the dusk with reviving interest.
There was surely something wrong with this man's
brain.  If ever John Ryder had seen a man with
beclouded mind, John B. White was that man.
</p>

<p>
"And I saw&mdash;saw your&mdash;er&mdash;wife," went on
White.  "She looked so like&mdash;well, like what I
thought my friend&mdash;one of my friends&mdash;would
look&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My wife looks like somebody you know?"  Ryder
asked in that loud and cheerful tone which
the average person uses in addressing one who he
thinks is not mentally balanced.
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es.  As I thought she'd look.  And her
name&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What name?" demanded Ryder.
</p>

<p>
White ignored the question.  "You see, I've
been away so long," he murmured.  "I didn't know
just how she would look.  We had never exchanged
photographs in all that time."
</p>

<p>
Ryder glanced at him curiously.  "You come
from Rome, the clerk tells me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," admitted the man, looking startled again.
"I&mdash;I only recently arrived in the country."
</p>

<p>
"Recently arrived from an insane asylum, more
like," thought John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"And, then, your wife," reiterated White.
"You&mdash;you haven't been married to her long?"
</p>

<p>
"I should say not!" groaned Ryder.  "Not long
enough to get used to being a married man.  We
were only married yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Not married <i>here</i>?" gasped White.
</p>

<p>
"No.  In New York.  Just before coming here,"
replied Ryder, wonderingly.  "And I wish heartily
we hadn't come here.  We're in a nice mess."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;unfortunate," said White.  "Your case
is indeed unhappy.  A bridegroom and bride.  Dear,
dear!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder still gazed at him wonderingly.  "If ever
I have seen a man who has slipped his trolley, this
White is that man!" he thought.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I suppose you and Mrs. Ryder had looked
forward to a very different sort of a honeymoon?"
said White, bending forward to devour his
companion's face in the dusk, his own eyes glowing
in the wild way which had already attracted Ryder's
notice.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed yes," Ryder admitted, with a chuckle, the
drink Jimson had mixed for him having had a
soothing effect.  "But we were neither of us
thinking of honeymoons when we embarked on the
<i>Minnequago</i>."
</p>

<p>
The man started.  "You&mdash;you mean when you
embarked on the ship?  You only landed from her
yesterday morning?"
</p>

<p>
"That is when she docked," the puzzled Ryder
replied.  "We were married not long after.  My
wife, you see, is an English girl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"An English girl!  Yes?"  A faint tone of
disappointment colored the remark.  White subsided
for a moment into deep thought.  Suddenly, as
Ryder was about to rise, the other clutched his arm
feverishly.  "I beg your pardon!  One other
question&mdash;if you will bear with me, Mr. Ryder.
Will&mdash;will you tell me your wife's name?
</p>

<p>
"Why, Ryder!" ejaculated the other.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I mean before she was married?"
</p>

<p>
"Mont&mdash;Ruth Mont," and Ryder broke away
from the man and walked to the desk to set his
empty glass upon the counter.  George was telling
a story&mdash;one of those interminably long yarns
which begin, "There was an Irishman, and."  He
was the only person who was facing the divan on
which White was sitting.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the clerk's face turned puttylike, and
he stopped, his jaw hanging.  He glared over the
shoulders of his audience.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you?" demanded the
nervous Jimson, jumping up.
</p>

<p>
"Look there!" exclaimed George.  "What's the
matter with that man?"
</p>

<p>
They all wheeled at his question to look.  But
while the others were moved first by White's
appearance, as George had been, Ryder saw the face
of Miss Solomons, the house detective, hanging over
the balustrade of the stairs, just above the place
where he had been sitting with White.  She dodged
back out of sight; and then Ryder saw what had
startled the hotel clerk.
</p>

<p>
White had slid down in his seat, with only the
small of his back resting on its edge, the back of
his head rigidly against the settee back and his legs
stretched stiffly before him.  His face was purple
in color and he was gasping for breath.
</p>

<p>
"The man's in a fit!" cried Jimson.
</p>

<p>
There was a concerted rush toward White, all
but Ryder joining in the stampede.  He remained
by the desk, staring up the stairway and wondering
what was the matter with Miss Solomons, who he
supposed had gone back to her broken sleep in the
parlor chair.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce does the girl want?" he thought.
"Was she spying on me or on White?  And what is
the matter with White, all of a sudden?  What
threw him into such a state?  What did he ask me
last?  Why!  Ruth's maiden name&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
George came charging back to the desk.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mr. Ryder! isn't Doctor Hoyle up in your
rooms?"
</p>

<p>
"I left him there," grumbled Ryder.  "He and
my wife are putting that Judson woman to bed."
</p>

<p>
George tore around the desk to the telephone.  He
stuck the proper plug into the board and began to
pump the annunciator in Ryder's apartment.  The
other men picked the stiffened White up and laid
him on the couch.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
THE EAGLE EYE OF THE HOUSE DETECTIVE
</h3>

<p>
George began at once to shout "Hullo!" into the
instrument.  Finally he got a reply from Suite
Three.  It was the doctor himself who answered
the insistent call from the hotel desk.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, this is George!" ejaculated the clerk.
"Come down here to the office at once, Doc.
Something's happened to Mr. White&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  I dunno.  He's fallen in a
fit&mdash;looks awful&mdash;face as black as your hat!"
</p>

<p>
The clerk was excited and he spread it on rather
thick.  Still, White did look bad.
</p>

<p>
George came away from the telephone.  "He'll
be right down," he said aloud.  "I guess your wife's
scared, Mr. Ryder.  I heard her scream."
</p>

<p>
Ryder was immediately troubled.  His own
nerves were jumping.  No wonder if Ruth should
become frightened.  There was nothing he could
do for White, and he started for the stairway.
Half way up the flight he passed the doctor, bag in
hand, charging down.  This was certainly a busy
night for the hotel physician.
</p>

<p>
And then, as Ryder reached the top of the
stairway, he saw another figure coming along the
corridor&mdash;a white-faced, gasping woman, with eyes
like coals, rushing like a whirlwind into his arms&mdash;a
whirlwind of laces and ruffles and ribbons, with a
boudoir cap over one ear and her tiny bare feet
twinkling in and out under her trailing robes.
</p>

<p>
It was Ruth, and she was the picture of fright.
</p>

<p>
"My heavens!" gasped Ryder, "what's the matter,
girlie?  What's frightened you so?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  She saw him then and clutched him
tightly about the neck.  "I&mdash;I thought something
had happened to you.  They said so&mdash;I heard the
clerk speaking through the 'phone to the doctor&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Ryder soothingly.  "It was
another man.  He was taken ill down there in the
office."  He could not tell her, now that she was so
disturbed, that it was the stranger who had already
annoyed her.  "Why, sweetheart, don't sob so!
I'm all right.  Don't you see I am?  Never was
sick a day that I remember in my whole life.  You
couldn't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He looked over her head, and there was the
sharp face of Miss Solomons at the parlor door.
The sharp eye of the house detective seemed
devouring them both.  Ryder felt a shocking desire
to consign both the house detective and Mrs. Judson
to the same place&mdash;and that a spot not often
mentioned in polite company.
</p>

<p>
But to Ruth he murmured: "Brace up, girlie!
It's all right&mdash;it's all right, I tell you.  You've been
overdoing.  This confounded Mrs. Judson has been
too much for you."
</p>

<p>
She still clung tightly to him, sobbing, her head
buried on his shoulder.  He gathered her up in his
arms, holding her yielding body close against his
breast, and carried her swiftly along the corridor.
As he passed the parlor he glared at Miss Solomons.
</p>

<p>
Once he halted to pick up one of the slippers Ruth
had lost in her flight down the hall.  The other
was in the doorway of their suite.  He strode in
with her, kicked shut the door, and placed Ruth
tenderly upon the couch.  The heavy lady was not
in sight.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mrs. Judson!" Ruth gasped.  "The doctor
left me to take care of her."
</p>

<p>
"Hang Mrs. Judson!" exclaimed Ryder.  "Is
she to be tied about our necks like a millstone?  Is
she our Old Man of the Sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Sh!"  She put her own lips to his.  "Don't be
offensive, dear boy!" she gasped after a long
breathless kiss which shook both of them.  "She&mdash;she
can't help being&mdash;well!&mdash;being just what she is."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted John Ryder with much
doubt.  "Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"In there," Ruth replied nodding toward the
inner room.  "Oh!  I am so glad you are all right,
I could forgive Mrs. Judson everything now!" she
whispered, snuggling her face down against his
breast again.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hanged if I forgive her for spoiling this
night for us," growled he.
</p>

<p>
"But there are other nights&mdash;hundreds of
them&mdash;thousands&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" demanded he.  "And we
never saw her in our lives before last evening!  By
thunder! this is the unluckiest old hole of a hotel.
I'm almost tempted to ask you to pack up again.
Some honeymoon!"
</p>

<p>
"But how would we get away from here?" she
asked, wonderingly.  "They say there are no
passenger trains on this short line to Pinewood.  And
until the bridge is repaired, how can we get to the
station at Barr, on the main line?"
</p>

<p>
"There is a combination that runs down to the
Junction at eight and another at one o'clock,
besides the evening train," John Ryder said.  "Of
course, it is not very luxurious.  But you say the
word, and I'll get the telegraph to working in the
morning and we'll have a special sent up here."
</p>

<p>
"A special what?" she asked in wonderment.
</p>

<p>
"Special train."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  You foolish boy!  How extravagant!
Why, you talk as though you were a millionaire!"
cried Ruth, laughing up into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Ryder halted.  Did she not know he was very
wealthy?  He had not boasted of his money, but
surely, on the <i>Minnequago</i>, he had told her enough
about his circumstances for her to realize that she
had married a very wealthy man.
</p>

<p>
She was speaking again now, and rather seriously.
"I don't really think I want to go, dear.
Not right away.  I want time to look about the old
place.  We must walk through the pines&mdash;and down
to the inlet where the crabbing used to be so good.
You know the places we want to see, John."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Do I?" asked John Ryder in growing surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  Now, don't make believe you are
not sentimental.  I know you are," and she squeezed
him tightly about the throat until there was grave
danger of his choking.
</p>

<p>
Ryder had moved over into a big armchair and
had taken Ruth with him.  "So I am sentimental,
am I?" he said.  "You seem to know a deal about
me for a man you've seen so short a time."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but," she responded, "remember how often
I have thought of you since&mdash;well, since I was a
tiny girl.  I've often imagined just how you'd look
and just the sort of man you'd be."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you did!" muttered Ryder.  Then:
"Do all girls dream about their future husbands
and wonder what they will look like?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so.  Only, all of them are not so sure
of the kind of man he will be as I was."
</p>

<p>
John Ryder was vastly puzzled again.  He gazed
down at her as she lay there in his arms and asked:
"Do&mdash;do you think I fill the bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not altogether as to looks, perhaps.  You
know, hubby, you are not a bit romantic looking."
and she smiled at him roguishly.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I suppose I am not&mdash;thank fortune!" and
he grinned in return.  "If I wore my hair long, and
sported a velvet jacket and broad collar, for
instance&mdash;&mdash;  Well! what do you suppose they would
do with me in business?"
</p>

<p>
"I know.  You are awfully practical.  That really
is surprising," she murmured.  "But the minute
you took my hands and I looked into your
eyes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"On the dock, you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, on the dock where I waited for you."
</p>

<p>
"And <i>then</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, then I knew I loved you.  I wasn't sure
before.  If you hadn't been&mdash;well&mdash;just you, I'd
have run away and you'd never have seen me again,
hubby.  I made up my mind to that."
</p>

<p>
"To run away from me if I didn't suit?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you sent your trunks to the station
just the same?" and he laughed into her blushing
face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that was only so as to be ready to go
with you if you proved to be as nice as you did.
Otherwise&mdash;well, there are other places on the
Pennsylvania Road to go to, besides Pinewood."
</p>

<p>
"So I measured up, when you had considered
everything, to your idea of what a husband should
be?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, dear!  You were all that was to be
desired," and she patted his cheek tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Say!" exclaimed Ryder, "I'm not sure I'll be
able to wear my hat tomorrow.  I can feel my head
increasing in size momently.  You'll make me
conceited."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only proud."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I'm the proudest man alive to get you!"
</p>

<p>
"Now, you mustn't say that.  I am just a poor
girl.  I would have to work hard for my living all
my life if you hadn't come for me."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody else, of course, would have taken pity
on you?" he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but there could have been nobody else.  You
were meant for me.  You were the only one."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you saw it that way," he laughed, "and
realized what a stage career meant before it was too
late."
</p>

<p>
She turned squarely to look at him then, a puzzled
little frown marring her brow.  "What&mdash;what
did you say?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
They were both startled the next moment by a
shriek from the inner room.
</p>

<p>
"Help!  I'm&mdash;I'm robbed!  My rings&mdash;my
brooches&mdash;my necklace!  I know I am robbed!"
</p>

<p>
It was the hysterical voice of Mrs. Judson.  They
heard her bound out of bed.  The whole house
seemed to rock when she landed on the bedroom
floor.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" ejaculated a sharp voice behind the bride
and bridegroom, "about what I expected."
</p>

<p>
It was Miss Solomons.  How she had got into
the suite Ryder did not ask.  His wife had started
for the inner room, crying:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor Mrs. Judson!  I really forgot her."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forgive me!" groaned the bridegroom,
shaking both fists in the air, as he sat in the
armchair from which his wife had leaped.  "I wish that
woman would either be gathered peacefully to her
ancestors, or&mdash;or get married again!"
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to find the eye of the house
detective upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" said that individual, "if you dared maybe
you'd add murder to larceny!  How about it?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
SOME SLEUTH
</h3>

<p>
"Now, stop right where you are," said Miss Solomons,
as John Ryder started to rise.  "I'll search
you later&mdash;and that woman.  I knew there was
somethin' fishy about all this.  I was a chump not to
see into it right at the start.  Of course Mrs. Judson
is just the sort of a party a pair of crooks would
get their hooks into."
</p>

<p>
"Say, are you crazy, or am I?"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down!"
</p>

<p>
At Ryder's second attempt to rise the house
detective unlimbered her artillery.  For the life of
him Ryder could not guess where she could hide
the big revolver about her person, she was so thin.
Holding the weapon recklessly aimed in his direction,
Miss Solomons began to search the sitting-room
scientifically.
</p>

<p>
In the bed chamber Ruth could be heard soothing
the refractory patient.  Mrs. Judson was still
bewailing the loss of her jewelry.
</p>

<p>
"My rings!  My brooches!  My necklace!" she
kept repeating, her voice rising in crescendo until
John Ryder thought the whole hotel would be
roused and come crowding into his suite.
</p>

<p>
"But, Mrs. Judson," Ruth said, when the heavy
lady stopped for breath, "you know you did not
wear your necklace or a brooch here.  Only your
rings&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My rings!  Where are my rings, then?"
demanded the invalid, and the bed-spring creaked
as she dropped upon it again.  "I know I have been
robbed!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure thing!" muttered Miss Solomons, still
holding John Ryder under the point of her weapon
while she poked into the umbrella stand near the
door with his walking stick.
</p>

<p>
Then Ruth, in a very small voice: "Why, I&mdash;I
took them off, Mrs. Judson."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" was Miss Solomon's comment, leaving
the umbrella stand.
</p>

<p>
"What for?  My rings!" cried Mrs. Judson.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor told me to.  We wanted to chafe
your hands.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What did you do with them?" snapped Miss
Solomons, and tore aside the curtain so as to get
a view of the bed chamber.
</p>

<p>
This time Ryder rose up, pistol or not.
</p>

<p>
"Come away from there!" he commanded.
</p>

<p>
"Anybody but an idiot would see that my wife
knows nothing about the woman's rings."
</p>

<p>
"Your wife?  You mean your accomplice,"
sneered the house detective.
</p>

<p>
"By heaven!  If you were only a man!" gasped
Ryder, and took a stride toward Miss Solomons.
</p>

<p>
"This here's loaded," said that woman firmly,
and stuck the barrel of her revolver against his
waistband again.  "No foolin' with me.  Sit down.
Come on out here, you!" she added over her
shoulder to Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why, what is the matter?" the latter
gasped, coming to the doorway.  "Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"What did you do with the rings?" demanded the
house detective.
</p>

<p>
She was still shoving against the pistol, and
naturally John Ryder fell back before such pressure.
When he dropped into the chair again Ruth
screamed.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" exclaimed Miss Solomons, seeing the
direction of Ruth's frightened gaze.  "That lamp,
eh?  Opened the oil tank and dropped 'em in, did
you?  Likely place!  But 'tain't new.  All you
crooks have the old stuff.  Not an original one
among you."
</p>

<p>
She started for the table, still keeping Ryder
covered.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" gasped Ruth.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Judson's rings," declared Miss Solomons
decisively.
</p>

<p>
"I dropped them into the doctor's medicine case.
He took them with him when he was called
downstairs," Ruth said and then, blessed with a sense
of the ridiculous, she began to giggle.
</p>

<p>
The house sleuth halted and looked from Ryder
to his bride.  Suspicion seemed fairly to sharpen
her nose as she sniffed.  "That's a likely story,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
Ryder took a hand, now having gained his
self-control.  "Do give us credit for some originality,
Miss Solomons," he said.  "If we have stolen
Mrs. Judson's gems we naturally would have an
accomplice on whom to plant them.  Who more likely
than the doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" snorted Miss Solomons.
</p>

<p>
The doctor himself appeared at the moment
The house detective sprang forward and seized his
black case.
</p>

<p>
"What have you in this?" she demanded, having
slipped her weapon out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"Enough poison to even satisfy you, My Lady
Sleuth," remarked Dr. Hoyle, evidently having his
own private opinion of the house detective.  "What
mare's nest have you uncovered now?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Judson's rings have been nicked," observed
Miss Solomons, quite unabashed.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I dropped them into your case," said Ruth
apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"So you did.  Here they are," said the doctor,
flashing the gems in question.  "Satisfied, Miss
Solomons?  Then, if so, you and this&mdash;this gentleman,
here, would better go away.  You are likely
to disturb my patient with your noise."
</p>

<p>
Miss Solomons pulled the folded novel from the
bosom of her blouse.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she said shortly.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better go and help James watch Van
Scamp's 'Cheesemonger,'" Ryder observed.  "That's
about your limit as a sleuth."
</p>

<p>
Miss Solomons, without changing countenance in
the least, stalked away.  Before the doctor could
escape to the bedroom Ryder said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't fancy my wife staying here all night
to attend this woman.  She has had an exciting
day and evening.  You'll have another patient on
your hands if you don't have a care."
</p>

<p>
Hoyle glanced at Ruth's laughing face and shook
his head.
</p>

<p>
"Not as long as she sees the funny side of the
situation," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"It is an imposition!" declared Ryder, with more
heat.
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly," observed the doctor, with a
shrug of his shoulders; but Ruth placed her little
pink palm, light as a rose leaf, upon his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak so, Johnny," she whispered.  "She
needs some woman about her at this time."
</p>

<p>
"She's not sick."
</p>

<p>
"But she thinks she is&mdash;which is worse," laughed
Ruth.  Then to the doctor: "Don't mind him.  He
is the most indulgent of husbands after all.  I will
remain.  I told you that I have been trained to the
work of nursing."
</p>

<p>
"I see you have, Madam," said the doctor
cheerfully, and he went into the other room where
Mrs. Judson lay groaning and sobbing on the bed.
</p>

<p>
John Ryder, much vexed but in control of
himself now, said decidedly:
</p>

<p>
"Even the most indulgent husband must put
down his foot some time, Ruth.  If that woman
is not well enough to be removed to her own rooms
by morning we will let her have this apartment
and take another suite.  You can play the Good
Samaritan until then if you so desire.  But
remember! after this, and for the remainder of our
honeymoon, if we see any despoiled victim lying by the
roadside we will emulate the Jews and pass by on
the other side."
</p>

<p>
He did not even kiss her as he passed out, and
Ruth stood looking after him with quivering lips.
Everything that had gone before was by chance,
and unlucky.  But this was actually the first jarring
note in the honeymoon!

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE CAT SHOWS HER CLAWS
</h3>

<p>
Ryder had got all over the desire for human
company.  He did not even care to ask how White was
getting along, and the doctor had said not a word
about the man.  Ryder was just about worn out.
What he wanted was rest and sleep.
</p>

<p>
He sought the parlor, determined to find a
comfortable chair there, in spite of Miss Solomons.
But the house detective did not appear to be present.
James had fallen into a chair himself, and was
snoring with his head upon the back of the seat.
Mr. Cudger was sleeping as peacefully as a child.
"The Cheesemonger" could have been stolen by
anybody who desired a new sail for a catboat, for
instance, and had a sharp knife to cut away the
canvas from its frame.
</p>

<p>
Ryder settled into a chair with a groan, first being
sure that it was unoccupied.  He closed his eyes.
He was almost asleep when this disturbing thought
partially aroused him:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ruth a trained nurse</i>?  She spoke of it before.
But she never told me aboard the <i>Minnequago</i>.  I
remember distinctly that she said she had learned
nothing she could turn to good account, now that
she was left to her own resources, save her talent
for stage entertainment.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! perhaps nursing isn't a well paid
profession in England.  In America, I believe, when a
trained nurse enters one's home, one might as well
hand her the bankbook.
</p>

<p>
"Don't understand it," said this new-made cynic.
"Huh!  There's a lot of things I don't understand.
One is, <i>Why is a honeymoon?</i>
</p>

<p>
"I've heard it said a man gets his eyes opened
after he's married.  I swear my vision is fast
becoming clouded.  There are a lot of things I want
explained.  Goodness! am I developing suspicious
qualities that I never knew I possessed before?
It does seem as though a dozen things poor Ruth
has said puzzle me mightily.
</p>

<p>
"It must be because we have known each other
so short a time, and our whole affair was so
hurried.  Goodness!  I haven't found time yet to learn
whether I am a benedict or still a bachelor.  But
how easily she assumes the little airs and graces
of a bride!
</p>

<p>
"I suppose most womenly women are so.  Their
whole young lives are lived in preparation for this
event&mdash;the event of giving themselves into the
keeping of the man they love."  Ryder lacked expert
knowledge on this point, it will be noted.  "And
what an imaginary little thing she is!  Miss
Solomons has nothing on Ruth when it comes to
imagination," and Ryder made a face in the dark at
thought of the house detective.
</p>

<p>
"To think of a girl's dreaming about what her
husband, whom she does not know and never has
heard of, will be like; fairly conjuring up a vision
of the man which the real husband, when he
appears, has to stack up against.
</p>

<p>
"Bless her heart!  If she believes me half as fine
and noble as the picture she imagined of the man she
some day expected to marry&mdash;&mdash;  By thunder!  I
wonder what is in that locket she wears and gazes
at so fondly?"
</p>

<p>
The thought pretty well awoke him.  He cursed
himself roundly, and aloud, and James stirred in
his sleep and groaned.
</p>

<p>
"Great heavens!  That thought is unworthy of
me&mdash;and of her!" Ryder muttered.  "Bless her
sweet face!  No woman could hold sacred the
memento of another man and show so clearly&mdash;as
does Ruth&mdash;that she loves her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Can I ever forget how she looked just now
running through that hall?  She was wild to think
that some harm had befallen me&mdash;befallen her
husband.  No mistake there, John Ryder!  You are it.
You are the man she loves."
</p>

<p>
He sighed ecstatically.  He closed his eyes.  He
fell asleep almost at once.  James was snoring
gently.  Old Cudger added his nasal murmur to
James' snores.  And from a distant corner that
John Ryder had overlooked, the eagle eye of the
house detective still watched him.
</p>

<p>
When John Ryder awoke he was stiff and lame
and chilled to his marrow.  The candles had burned
down to puddles of grease in the saucers.  A cold
gray light stole into the parlor through a high
window and lay in a comfortless mantle over
Mr. Cudger, James and "The Cheesemonger."
</p>

<p>
The heart in John Ryder lay like lead.  Never
had he risen with such a sickening premonition of
ill as upon this gloomy Saturday morning.
Indeed, John Ryder was not in the habit of having
premonitions at all.
</p>

<p>
He was a healthy, sane and perfectly level-headed
individual.  Never before in his busy life had he
found time for romance; and certainly the brand of
romance that Fate had handed out to him since the
<i>Minnequago</i> had docked did not encourage Ryder
to wish for more.
</p>

<p>
"It was Friday!" he suddenly muttered.  "No
wonder everything went wrong.  Friday!"
</p>

<p>
He was hungry for a sight of Ruth's face and
for a word with her.  In spite of the feeling within
him that everything had gone wrong during the
past several hours, he turned to the thought of
his beautiful girl-wife as a child turns to its mother
when it wishes comfort.
</p>

<p>
Circumstances may have handed John Ryder
some awful jolts during the past night; but his
thought of Ruth was one of joy and the delight of
possession.  He started, rubbing his eyes and
yawning, for Suite Three.
</p>

<p>
Just as he reached the door a maid came out.  She
evidently recognized Ryder when he asked:
</p>

<p>
"What's going on in there this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's sleeping, sir.  Just as swate as a baby.
I've been filling the heater again and I left it
burning, sir, so it would be warm when she gets up.  Yes,
sir.
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Mrs. Judson?" Ryder asked gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Bless you!  No, sir.  <i>She</i> went back to her own
room hours ago.  Doctor says she's all right.  Gittin'
scare't about her jool'ry cured her quicker than
his medicines."
</p>

<p>
"She's gone!" cried Ryder in delight.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Oh, thank you, sir!  'Tis your own
little lady I was spakin' of.  Shall&mdash;shall I open
the door for ye, sir, with me pass key?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" said John Ryder, blushing a little but
feeling extremely relieved.  "I won't disturb her
if she's sleeping," and he immediately turned
toward the breakfast room.
</p>

<p>
Going down the main stairway, he saw Colonel
Aurelius Brack and his wife before him, the
doughty colonel having difficulty in making the
trip because of his artificial limb.  He had gone up
to his room the night before while the elevators
were still running, and now depended upon the
balustrade and his wife's arm to get safely to the
bottom of the flight of steps.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Brack was a delightfully motherly looking
woman with a face as peaceful as the colonel's was
stormy.  He scowled savagely at John Ryder.  The
latter wished for no words with the old fire-eater,
especially in the presence of his wife; but as he
would have passed them the woman placed a
detaining hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"You are Mr. Ryder?" she asked sweetly.
</p>

<p>
Ryder felt his face flush, and he was as confused
as a boy caught in some peccadillo.  He was
sorry now that, in his ill temper, he had treated the
colonel so cavalierly in the café.  The colonel looked
away from the younger man, but the latter could
not avoid Mrs. Brack's searching gaze.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you are the gentleman who put himself
out to make me comfortable," she said softly.
"I thank you very much for the stove and light.  It
was very good of you to remember an old woman&mdash;and
a stranger.  But I hope we will not be
strangers now.  I want to meet your charming wife,
whom I saw at dinner last evening."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Madam!" exclaimed Ryder, his
coldness melted instantly by her courtesy.  "But
you should thank the clerk and the steward.
Without their advice and assistance I should not have
known those guests who were clearly entitled to
consideration."
</p>

<p>
He bowed and passed down ahead of the old
couple.  There was a strange face at the desk in
place of George's so he went on to the breakfast
room where Al himself stood directing the guests
to their tables.  There was plainly a dearth of
waiters.  Several of the oil heaters had been brought
in here, and with screens about the tables to fend
off any possible draught, the guests were being
made comfortable.
</p>

<p>
As Ryder stopped to speak to Al, Mrs. Judson
and the hard-featured committee woman of the
S.B.C.D.G. swept in.  The widow did not look
like a person who had spent a hard night.  Ryder
felt his gorge rise at her fresh and rejuvenated
appearance.
</p>

<p>
Ruth had been utterly worn out and he had spent
a most woful time from midnight till dawn, all
because of this hysterical woman.  And here she was
as fresh as a daisy!  That the widow bowed very
distantly to him, Ryder did not remark&mdash;nor would
he have cared in the least had he noticed her
haughtiness.
</p>

<p>
"Let me find a table for you, Mr. Ryder," Al
said.  "Your lady will not be down?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet.  She is still asleep."
</p>

<p>
"I'll speak to the chef," promised the steward.
"She shall have something nice for breakfast sent
up to her when she rings.  We have warned most of
the other guests that it will be impossible to serve
breakfasts upstairs until we get more help."
</p>

<p>
He led Ryder to a small table next to that
occupied by Mrs. Judson and the other woman, but
there was a screen between the two tables and the
women did not know of Ryder's presence.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't that the Mr. Ryder who bought the
lamps for us?" the hard-featured woman asked,
quite loud enough for the man in question to hear.
"That man who stood in the doorway?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" ejaculated the widow, "<i>is</i> that his name?
Are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
"So I am told.  He was pointed out to me last
evening by a gentleman who knows him.  John
Ryder.  One of the shrewdest speculators in Wall
Street they say.  Quite remarkable that he should
have played the Good Angel to us all after cornering
the heating and lighting supplies of the town,"
and she laughed unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my!" drawled Mrs. Judson.  "Are you
<i>sure, quite sure</i>, that is his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;I&mdash;declare!" gasped the widow, breathlessly.
Ryder might have risen and sought another
table, but her next words held him motionless in
his chair.  "Do you know, I <i>thought</i> there was
something very odd about them.  I never heard
the like in all my life!  And I should have <i>known</i>,
too, after what Miss Solomons said.  <i>She</i> declares
they tried to rob me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who tried to rob you?" exclaimed the other
woman, evidently puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"This Ryder, as he calls himself, and that woman
with him."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Ryder is his name I tell you," declared
her vis-à-vis at table.
</p>

<p>
"Then," said the widow in an impressive tone,
"that woman with him is not his wife."
</p>

<p>
"<i>What!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Ryder might have uttered that exclamation himself,
there was so much emphasis in it.  The dull
red of rage rose in his cheek.  He was tempted to
leap up and kick aside the screen and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;it is awful!" wailed Mrs. Judson.  "And
people have seen me with them.  I&mdash;I was over-urged
by them to take supper at their table last
night.  And it was in their rooms I had my bad
spell later.  You know, dear, I am not at all
myself when I get hysterical.  I am not accountable
for what I do.  The doctor says so himself.  But
when Miss Solomons interfered and kept them
from robbing me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Robbing you!" gasped the other woman.  "How
terrible!"
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't it?  That girl really is sharp.  Of course,
it seems strange to have a girl for a house detective,
and she is dreadfully slangy and bookish&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!" murmured the other.  "But tell me
about this Ryder and the woman?  Of course, he
would not have robbed you.  It must have been the
woman&mdash;some awful creature he has brought here,
of course.  Men are such beasts!"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't they?" agreed the widow.  "And she
gave me quite another name from Ryder.  The bold
thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Are they here under an alias?" gasped the other
gossip.  "I was told they had only just been married."
</p>

<p>
"They can't be married at all.  She doesn't go by
his name.  I never heard of anything so disgraceful&mdash;and
right here at the Pinewood Inn which is
supposed to be so select."
</p>

<p>
Ryder rose up so suddenly that he kicked over
his chair.  He wanted to kick away the screen, too,
and fall tooth and nail upon "that old cat who
dared say such vile things about Ruth."
</p>

<p>
Not daring to trust himself even to look at the
two women, he hurried out of the room, completely
forgetting his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"There!" he muttered, striding in the direction of
the café.  "That serves us right for associating
with strangers.  Ruth shouldn't have taken up with
her in the first place.
</p>

<p>
"Hang it!  I should not have allowed the woman's
familiarity myself.  I could have nipped it in the
bud last night at supper.  I shouldn't expect an
unsophisticated girl like Ruth to see through such
an old stager as that Judson.  And Miss Solomons!  Gad!
</p>

<p>
"How can human beings be so cruel to each
other?  Women in particular!  It is a mystery to me!
</p>

<p>
"What did the old cat mean about Ruth giving
her another name?  I swear I must have a talk with
Ruth.  Not my wife?  Heavens on earth! when I've
got the certificate of our marriage right here in my
pocket?" and he struck himself on the breast with
emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"If that old fool keeps up her clatter I may have
to have the certificate photographed and a copy
handed to every guest of the Pinewood Inn!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE DUTY AGAIN DEVOLVES
</h3>

<p>
Ryder feed a waiter to bring him some breakfast
into the café and did something he had never done
before in his life&mdash;drank a "life saver" before the
morning meal.
</p>

<p>
"If this goes on," muttered John Ryder, "I shall
become a sot.  I have drunk more between-meal
drinks within the last twenty-four hours than I
ever did before in my life.  They say getting
married sobers most men; it seems as though it may
utterly wreck <i>me</i>&mdash;morally!"
</p>

<p>
When he wandered back into the office George
had returned and beckoned him to the desk.
</p>

<p>
"I've had a couple of hours' sleep, Mr. Ryder,
and that's all," the clerk said.  "And it's all I guess
I'll get.  Mr. Manger hasn't come back and isn't
likely to; and although Jim Howe is willing, he's
only good for detail work.  He's got to come to
me to ask about every little thing.  And now, by
Jove! <i>I've</i> got to come to you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Come to me?" growled Ryder.  "What for?
I'm through.  You can't expect me to shoulder the
responsibilities of running this hotel."
</p>

<p>
"I just want your advice, Mr. Ryder," said
George, the foxy.  "Look around at these other
men.  They are all useless to me now.  Aside from
Al&mdash;who has his own work&mdash;you are the only man
with a head on him."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure whether I have a head or not,"
grumbled Ryder.  "But fire up!  What's happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I filed a telegram to Mr. Giddings last
night, and here's what I get in reply," the clerk
hastened to say, handing the crumpled sheet to
Ryder.  It read:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Giddings out of town.  Return Monday.  Should
advise keeping house open at any cost.&mdash;BLACKMAN."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Now, I don't know who the dickens Blackman
is, unless he's Mr. Giddings' chief clerk," the
worried George said.  "But this wire doesn't give me
proper authority to go ahead and contract bills,
promise to pay help, and all that.  I don't know
how to reach any of the Barnaby heirs.  They may
read something about our trouble in the papers this
afternoon, for our local correspondent is on the
job.
</p>

<p>
"But the heirs will expect Giddings to attend to
it.  The help are troublesome&mdash;those that have
remained.  Al has his hands full, believe me!  And
the guests are kicking like steers about the heating.
We've got to have coal."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you buy a little in the town?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be mighty little.  These dealers
here&mdash;and there are only two of them&mdash;buy from hand to
mouth, as you might say.  And then, Mr. Ryder,
I'm a poor man.  My salary isn't big.  This looks
like a diamond in my tie," and George grinned;
"but it is pure glass.  I wear it because it seems a
man can't be a sure-enough hotel clerk without
wearing what looks like a 'chunk of ice.'
</p>

<p>
"You know," the clerk added more seriously,
"Bangs bought his coal from the railroad
company."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you get some from them?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I tried to bluff them on it," said George.
"I managed to get them on the telephone at the
Junction&mdash;Divisional Supervisions office.  There
is still something wrong with the long distance
service.  They can get us a car by next Tuesday; not
a minute before."
</p>

<p>
"These folks'll freeze to death here," said Ryder.
"It's already colder this morning.  And there's
nothing being done to that bridge, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't get the farmers to work on Saturday
if you offered them double wages," declared
the clerk.  "The reputation of the Pinewood Inn
will be ruined.  And I'd hate to see the doors closed
and all these people put out."
</p>

<p>
"And nowhere to go," Ryder said thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"You've said a mouthful," groaned George, but
watching the other sharply.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" exclaimed Ryder, suddenly smiting
the counter with a clenched fist.  He scented
the battle like a warhorse and forgot his personal
troubles for the moment.  This emergency appealed
to him.  "I can't see you beat this way, boy," he
declared.
</p>

<p>
"But what'll I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait till I take a look around the village.  Sit
tight and say nothing."
</p>

<p>
"If the steam isn't knocking in those pipes pretty
soon I am going to have a mob at this desk ready
to tar and feather me, Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"If they do it, you tell me," chuckled the business
man with an answering grin, and, having his hat
and coat with him, he started for the door without
further loss of time.
</p>

<p>
It looked to Ryder as though it was up to him
to take hold of the wheel of affairs again and give it
a whirl.  Ruth had expressed a desire to remain
at the hotel; and certainly she could not stay
without heat and light.
</p>

<p>
Besides, Ryder had an additional reason for
remaining.  If Mrs. Judson circulated her rumors
and lies among the guests, certainly John Ryder
and the woman to whom he had given his name and
to whom he had entrusted his honor, could not
afford, even seemingly, to run away.
</p>

<p>
In his present mood he would have made an offer
to buy the hotel and run it as he saw fit, providing
he could get the owners of the Pinewood Inn to
agree on a price.  Under no consideration or
circumstances could he allow the guests to believe
there was anything queer about Ruth.  They must
remain.
</p>

<p>
And "that impudent and half-baked house
detective," which was the way he thought of Miss
Solomons, was likely to make as much trouble for
them as Mrs. Judson.  He did not mind what
people said of him; but he grew furious when he
thought of what might be said about Ruth.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, he took hold of this coal situation
with zest.  As he passed the local coal dealers on
the way to the shack that served Pinewood as a
station, he saw that George had been correct.  The
two dealers together did not have enough coal to
furnish the hotel with a proper supply for more
than a day or two.  The hotel needed a carload at
least.  And there should be two or three carloads
in the cellar to protect the guests if the house was
to remain open any length of time.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the station he saw upon a spur
track four gondolas heaped high with fuel.  A man
in cap and jumper, wheeling an empty truck, he
rightly identified as the station master and general
factotum of the company at this rather
unimportant station.
</p>

<p>
He halted the man.  "I want to buy some of
that coal," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Huh?"
</p>

<p>
Ryder repeated his observation, and the man
began to grin.  "Think I'm dealing in coal?  You've
struck the wrong man, boss."
</p>

<p>
"I represent the hotel," said Ryder.  "I
understand the railroad furnishes Pinewood Inn with
fuel."
</p>

<p>
"But not that coal," said the station master.
"That was shunted off here yesterday because the
old scrapheap they called an engine hitched to
Number Three couldn't pull her load over the rise
to Blandins.  That coal is billed to a factory up
there.  I couldn't touch that coal if I wanted to."
</p>

<p>
"Then put me in communication with the supervisor
of this division and I'll tell him the hotel must
have coal.  We're all out.  The manager has lit
out over night and left the bins empty and the guests
will freeze if we don't get coal.  I'll pay for it right
here, and you'll find that my check is good."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I ain't doubting that," said the agent.  "I
guess you're Mr. Ryder.  I've heard tell of you.
You near bought out Cal Crabtree's store last night,
they say.  But if you was the Angel Gabriel I
couldn't sell you a hodful of that coal&mdash;nossir!
Neither could the Super.  It's not the road's coal,
I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"The road, then, is merely acting as carrier?"
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Mister.  The Lossing Soap Factory
is going to get that coal."
</p>

<p>
"I want that coal," said John Ryder persuasively.
</p>

<p>
"Can't help it.  If I should sell you a pound of it,
I'd be li'ble to arrest for larceny, or burglary, or
somethin'.  Yes, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"If you can't sell it, I shall have to take it."
</p>

<p>
The station agent laughed.  He laughed loudly.
In fact he was still holding his sides and hee-hawing
when Ryder walked away.  The latter went
directly to Crabtree's store.
</p>

<p>
"Old man," he said to the storekeeper, and
accepting without a qualm one of Crabtree's "two-fors"
and lighting it, "what do teamsters ask here
for carting a load of coal?"
</p>

<p>
"They git fifty cents a ton."
</p>

<p>
"I want you to get me every man who owns a
horse and wagon, and will work, to cart coal from
the spur track yonder to the hotel.  Let 'em weigh
out and in on your scales.  I'll give a dollar a ton
providing they get to work quickly and stick to it."
</p>

<p>
"My soul and body!  Where'll you git the coal?"
gasped the storekeeper.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't <i>got</i> it.  But I am going to <i>take</i> it.  It's
there on the spur, and the hotel needs it.  Can't let
the women and children suffer.  Do you notice that
the thermometer is going down?"
</p>

<p>
"But what'll the railroad folks do?"
</p>

<p>
"You find me enough men and they won't do
anything.  We'll have what coal we need before
they can send a gang up here from the Junction&mdash;even
if they wish to.  This is a case of necessity and
Necessity, as our school-books used to tell us, knows
no law!"
</p>

<p>
"By jinks!" exclaimed Crabtree.  "They'll call
on the constable."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?  Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, he&mdash;he kinder thought to go fishin' today.
The sun didn't jes' rise to suit him.  But he can
git out now if he steps right smart, before anybody
can tell him he's likely to be called on."
</p>

<p>
"My soul, man!  Are you the constable?" gasped
John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Sh!  I'm storekeeper to you.  Don't speak loud
enough for the constable in me to hear," chuckled
the old fellow.
</p>

<p>
He went to the door and blew a horn.  "That'll
call my son, Sam.  He'll 'tend to things&mdash;and weigh
the coal.  I sha'n't be back 'fore supper time.  Sam'll
gather the clans, Mr. Ryder, and see that they work
right.  You ought to put a tidy lot of coal into them
hotel bins before the constable gits back," and the
storekeeper promptly disappeared.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE PRIVATE BUCCANEER
</h3>

<p>
The offer of double pay brought even some of the
neighboring farmers to life.  Within an hour a
string of carts of all descriptions wound its way
along the village street to the spur railroad track.
Ryder was there, chewing on a cigar, watching the
first loads taken from the cars.  The station master
came running, mad as a hatter.
</p>

<p>
"You can't do that, you derned fool!" he shouted,
shaking his fist in John Ryder's face.
</p>

<p>
"You watch and see if I can't."
</p>

<p>
"But you'll get into trouble.  You'll be arrested.
These fellers will be arrested.  Why, hang it! it's
high-handed piracy, that's what it is."
</p>

<p>
"If anybody is arrested I stand ready to pay the
bill," Ryder coolly told him.  "I tell you this is a
case of necessity."
</p>

<p>
Naturally the agent did not see it that way, and
he rushed to wire his headquarters.  Of course he
got orders to stop the robbery and came back and
bawled commands that nobody paid any attention to.
</p>

<p>
"You'll get neck deep into trouble over this," the
agent sputtered to Ryder.  "There is a sheriff on
the way here to arrest you."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  He'll find me at the hotel," and
having seen the first car cleaned out he strolled back
to Pinewood Inn.  He knew there would be enough
coal in the bins to last over Sunday at least.  Two
carloads was enough anyway, and he ordered the
work to cease when the second gondola was clean.
He left two cars for the Lossing Soap Factory.
</p>

<p>
Sam Crabtree furnished the cash needed and he
paid his teamsters; and when John Ryder entered
the hotel office again it was past eleven o'clock.
Steam was already knocking in the pipes, and the
hotel guests were beginning to smile once more.
</p>

<p>
Few had tried to leave.  A couple of unattached
men had gone on the eight o'clock combination that
jounced down to the Junction over the worst
ballasted road in seven states.  One man had cranked
up his automobile and tried to get away by the
back roads; but had come limping in again, having
been drawn out of the mire by a farmer with a team
of horses.
</p>

<p>
The hotel motorbus was still across the inlet;
and it was broken down anyway.  It would take
several days to repair it.  A few of the guests, with
light baggage only, had arranged to be punted
across the inlet and would walk to Barr, the station
on the main line.
</p>

<p>
The most of them, however, had made no plans to
get away.  Heat being supplied again, the promise
of lights as usual, and a reorganization of the
working force of the house, satisfied most of them that
matters would soon take their usual course.
</p>

<p>
John Ryder hoped that this was to be the fact.
He had done all&mdash;and more&mdash;than he desired to do
for the welfare and comfort of the company.  And
he certainly would not have assumed this last
responsibility regarding the coal supply had not Ruth
expressed a desire to remain here for the rest of
their honeymoon.
</p>

<p>
Jim Howe, the clerk's assistant, was at the desk,
and he spoke to Ryder as soon as the latter came
near.
</p>

<p>
"I say, sir, you're Mr. Ryder, aren't you?  Well,
there are two ladies been after you this morning,
they want to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Two ladies?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," and Howe had hard work to suppress a
grin.  "One's our house detective, Miss Solomons.
You had a run-in with her last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Something like that," returned Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"The lady with the craze for five-cent detective
fiction.  She's carrying one of those novels around
now&mdash;'The Great Limburger Cheese Mystery, or
Dick Squawker on a Strong Scent'; you know the
kind.  I used to read 'em when I was a kid.  But
she is after you."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" observed Ryder not at all pleased.
</p>

<p>
"And the lady in Suite Three," added Jim Howe,
now flashing the guest a sharp look.  "She's
asking for you.  Al sent up her breakfast and then
she telephoned down here to ask if her&mdash;ahem!&mdash;her
husband was about."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not know just who she meant at first,"
acknowledged Howe, still eying Ryder curiously.
"She&mdash;she did not get your name right."
</p>

<p>
The business man felt himself flushing.  But he
braved it out.  "Asked for her husband, didn't
she?"
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's me," and he moved away from the desk.
</p>

<p>
But he was suddenly impressed by the fact that
Ruth must have said or done something to stir up
suspicion at the hotel desk.  With Mrs. Judson
peddling her misinformation through the house, he and
his bride were likely to be misunderstood.  What
could it be?  Did Ruth mispronounce his name?
</p>

<p>
The puzzle of it enfolded him in a blanket of
doubt.  He went upstairs muttering to himself and
with clouded brow.
</p>

<p>
As he approached Parlor A he saw a familiar
figure standing at the door.  It was White&mdash;the
man who had been so suddenly and strangely taken
ill in the office during the night.  The man was
speaking to one of the boys, and Ryder saw him
give the messenger a card and a coin.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Suite Three.  Give it to the lady and tell
her I am waiting for her here."
</p>

<p>
White went quickly into the parlor and the boy
darted away.  Ryder was dumbfounded.  He was
fixed to his place in the corridor for some moments
before he could move.
</p>

<p>
White, the man of mystery, had sent his card to
his, Ryder's, wife!  He expected Ruth to come to
the parlor at his summons!
</p>

<p>
There could be no mistake about it.  Ryder was
sure enough now that Suite Three was the one he
had taken for himself and his bride.
</p>

<p>
White's questions the night before, Ruth's fear
of the man when he had come to the door, her
attempt at supper time to have private conversation
with White (Mrs. Judson's interference Ryder
now saw had broken up that) and various other
suspicious circumstances rose in Ryder's mind in
horrid procession.
</p>

<p>
He staggered forward a step until he was where
he could see into the parlor.  He was aware that
Miss Solomon's sharp face suddenly came within
range of his vision; but he did not give the steely
eyed house detective a second glance.  His eyes
were fixed on White.
</p>

<p>
Besides that individual, there seemed but two
other guests of the hotel in Parlor A.  Cudger and
James had disappeared.  Two women stood talking
beside one of the other doors.  They were the
vivacious Mrs. Judson and Mrs. Dent, the
hard-featured member of the advance committee of the
S.B.C.D.G.
</p>

<p>
Ryder hung back.  John B. White was pacing a
length of rug nervously.  Suddenly Ruth appeared
at the door beside which the widow and her
companion stood.
</p>

<p>
Ryder's heart leaped at the sight of his bride.
She looked as fresh and sweet as a rose.  She wore
a delightfully pretty house dress.  She carried what
was evidently White's card in her hand, and she
cast a puzzled glance about the parlor.  She first
saw Mrs. Judson.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mrs. Judson," she said brightly.
"I hope you are better?"
</p>

<p>
Up went the widow's lorgnette.  She stared
Mrs. Ryder up and down without replying.  Then she
deliberately turned her back without speaking, much
to Ruth's pain and surprise.
</p>

<p>
Ryder's gorge rose.  He was about to step
forward to protect Ruth when the latter saw White
and uttered a little cry.  The man wheeled and
came toward her.  Did Ruth shrink from him and
did she cry out in fear?
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I must speak to you," White said, as
Mrs. Judson and her companion left the room.  "At
least you owe me some reparation&mdash;some explanation.
I demand that of you!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
IT IS NO LONGER FARCE
</h3>

<p>
Ruth halted.  Her husband, from the other end
of the room, saw fear in her face&mdash;right down
terror!&mdash;as she confronted the man who addressed
her.
</p>

<p>
Nor was this surprising.  White's eyes glowed
unnaturally, his long black hair was disheveled and
his appearance altogether wild and uncanny.  Ruth
fell back from him, and Ryder heard her breath
come gaspingly.  Yet for the moment Ryder was
spellbound and unable to go to her protection.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what do you want of me?" she asked faintly.
</p>

<p>
"I sent for you.  I must talk with you," White
returned.
</p>

<p>
"Sent for me?" she said in a dully puzzled tone.
"Oh, no!  My husband sent for me."  She glanced
at the card in her hand.  "He&mdash;he sent me this
card&mdash;&mdash;  So strange&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She flashed White a suddenly indignant glance.
"You have tricked me!" she cried with more
force.  "You have obtained one of my husband's
cards&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That is my card, Ruth Mont!" White exclaimed
harshly.  "It is the card of the man whom you
should call 'husband'&mdash;who <i>is</i> your husband by
right.  <i>And I am that man!</i>"
</p>

<p>
A porter suddenly entered the door at John
Ryder's back.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mr. Ryder, sir?" he said.  "I was sent
after you.  Your trunks have been brought across
the inlet and we have them at the door of your suite.
Shall we take them inside and carry the empty
boxes downstairs, sir?"
</p>

<p>
How did he do it?  How does a man's brain
sometimes continue to work and his limbs to move
when he is sleep-walking?  The subconscious self
of John Ryder moved out of the parlor where two
human beings were in the throes of a gripping
tragedy&mdash;a tragedy that might scar his whole
future life&mdash;and led the porter back to Suite Three.
</p>

<p>
He opened the door with the key he had obtained
at the desk and saw the porters bring in the trunks.
He made them understand that they were to let
the empty boxes belonging to Ruth remain.  Then
he tipped them and was left alone.
</p>

<p>
He sat down in the very chair he had sat in before
and held Ruth in his arms, and awaited his wife's
return.  His wife!  God in heaven!  Was she his
wife?  White had claimed her as rightfully belonging
to him, and all those suspicious circumstances
that had heretofore rankled in John Ryder's mind
swam to the surface and offered proof that White's
statement was true.
</p>

<p>
What was this awful riddle that seared John
Ryder's soul as though with a branding iron?
</p>

<p>
He was convinced now that White was not a
madman.  Wild he might appear; but that he was
insane, that his strange speeches were the vaporings
of an unbalanced mind, Ryder did not now believe.
</p>

<p>
Why was he so sure that White was sane?  Because
Ruth had shown by her manner and by the
expression of her countenance that something in
White's statement impressed her.  Ryder had seen
her display this fear twice.  He was convinced that
White actually was closely associated with her, or
had been so in the past.
</p>

<p>
Yet Ruth was bound to him&mdash;Ryder.  She was
his wife.  He had been wedded to her less than
twenty-four hours before.  Twenty-four hours!  It
seemed a lifetime of storm and stress.
</p>

<p>
Ryder had promised to love, to cherish, to support
and defend from all harm, to&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My God!" he exclaimed, leaping up.  "Am I a
pusillanimous coward&mdash;a dastard?  I have left
her to face that man&mdash;whatever or whoever he
is&mdash;alone."
</p>

<p>
He started for the door, madly intending to go
back to the parlor and face them both.  The door
of the suite opened and closed swiftly.  Ruth came
in&mdash;the vision of a panting, wild-eyed, pallid-faced
woman.  She clung to the door knob for a moment,
striving to regain her breath, and staring strangely
into John Ryder's face.  When she spoke, what
she said shocked him as nothing else could have
done.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" she demanded.  "What&mdash;what
manner of man are you?  What did you do this to
me for?  <i>Why did you do it?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Do what?" asked Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you marry me?  Oh!" she cried in
despair, wringing her hands, "why did you do this
awful thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Why did I marry you?" repeated the man,
dumbfounded.  "Because I loved you.  I told you
I loved you when we were aboard ship, Ruth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Aboard ship!  Aboard what ship?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Minnequago</i>.  Surely you have not
forgotten our long talks?  You have not
forgotten&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Am I mad?" cried the woman, throwing her
arms wildly above her head.  "Oh!  I must be
mad!"  Then she gained sudden control over herself.
She thrust her face forward, her eyes blazing
into his.  "If you are my husband," she whispered,
"what is your name?"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>am</i> your husband," Ryder said sternly.  "You
were legally married to me yesterday.  Here is the
certificate which the minister gave you, and which
you placed in my hands for safe keeping."
</p>

<p>
He had dragged out his wallet and handed her
the folded document.  Her shaking fingers clutched
at it and finally got the stiff paper unfolded.  She
read the names aloud in crescendo:
</p>

<p>
"'Ruth A. Mont': 'John Ryder'.  "The paper
slipped from her fingers and fluttered to the floor.
"'John Ryder'?" she repeated staring at him.  "<i>I
never heard of you before!</i>"
</p>

<p>
She burst into tears, a passion of weeping that
shook her whole body.  For a moment she stood
before him, so near that he might have touched
her, her face in her trembling hands.  The man
stood still, dumb and helpless.
</p>

<p>
Then turning swiftly she ran into the inner room.
Ryder, at last awakened, started up.  He was
frightened by her vehemence, as well as amazed by
her words.
</p>

<p>
He started to follow her.  She had shut the door
sharply, but the key was not turned in the lock.  He
put his hand upon the door and hesitated.  And so
surely is the man lost who hesitates, John Ryder
was lost then!  There were two courses open to
him, and he chose the wrong one.
</p>

<p>
His hand left the knob, and with the sound of
the woman's wild sobbing in his ears he went slowly
down the room and out into the corridor.  As he
came in sight of the parlor door he saw White
wildly break from the room and run for the stairway.
John Ryder's senses were so dulled that he
scarcely saw the man.  But behind the departing
White appeared in the parlor doorway the figure
of Miss Solomons.  The expression upon the house
detective's face might have alarmed Ryder at
another time.  She fairly glared at him as he moved
past her.
</p>

<p>
"No, you ain't no crook, Mr. Ryder," he heard
the strange girl mutter.  "You're just a particular
blamed fool!  That's what you are."
</p>

<p>
He managed to get out of the hotel in some way
and stumbled along the sandy road to the shore of
the inlet where he might be alone.  He tramped
the edge of the inlet for miles.
</p>

<p>
His mind was back in the room at the hotel where
he had left Ruth.  The incident was as clearly
etched on his brain as it had been when he stood
and heard her amazing declaration.
</p>

<p>
What she meant he did not know.  What he
should have done he did not know.  That he had
done the wrong thing he was not sure.  But he had.
</p>

<p>
<i>Wrong</i>?  Indeed, his act had been the deadliest
wrong possible to the woman.  He was stunned,
he did not understand; but there was one thing of
which in his sane moments he was already
convinced: Ruth loved him.
</p>

<p>
Nothing should have superseded that in his mind.
Whatever the riddle was, whatever the skein of
mystery in which they two were entangled, he
should have remembered that.  Instead he had
allowed jealousy to step in and becloud the issue.
John Ryder had turned his back upon a woman who
had shown she loved him deeply.  He had deserted
her at a time when she needed him as she never
had before and probably never would again.
</p>

<p>
All the pain and passion which followed this
event John Ryder could lay to his own act.  He
brought all that followed upon himself by his own
unwisdom.  He was thinking only of himself.  He
was like a hurt animal, desiring to seek some lair
wherein to lick its wounds.
</p>

<p>
He walked on and on.  The in-running tide
lapped along the strand at his feet, the burden of
its murmur being:
</p>

<p>
"<i>I never heard of you before!</i>"
</p>

<p>
What had Ruth meant by that statement?  Was
it possible that she was insane?  What had that
fellow, White, said to her that had thrown her
mind into such confusion?
</p>

<p>
White!  At the remembrance of the man of
mystery Ryder suddenly spat out an oath.  He
could explain this thing; and Ryder suddenly registered
a vow that White should explain, or he would
have his life!
</p>

<p>
He was a man now enraged to the point of
desperation.  He started for the hotel with this single
idea milling in his brain.  More than an hour had
elapsed since he had left the Pinewood Inn, but
he had taken little note of the lapse of time.
</p>

<p>
He betrayed his disturbed state of mind when he
reached the desk where George presided.
</p>

<p>
"For mercy's sake, Mr. Ryder! what's happened
to you?" demanded the clerk.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I am looking for a man," stammered Ryder.
"You know&mdash;the fellow who threw a fit here last
night.  White&mdash;John B. White."
</p>

<p>
"What about him?"
</p>

<p>
"I want to see him."
</p>

<p>
"But he's gone, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Gone?  Left the hotel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  He had no heavy baggage, and he
got somebody to row him across the inlet.  There
are several fellows down there taking folks back
and forth because of the broken bridge.  I guess
he intended catching the two o'clock train on the
main line.  Had your lunch, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Ryder was not thinking of eating.  He walked
away from the desk without replying.  White was
gone.  Then who would explain to him&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>

<p>
Ruth!  He started up the stairway.  Instinctively
he sought Suite Three.  Yet when he arrived there
he hesitated.  Should he go in?  Could he face
Ruth?  What was he to say to her?
</p>

<p>
At last he turned the knob.  The door was unlocked.
He stepped into the room.  Its condition
instantly shocked his mind into activity.
</p>

<p>
The wardrobe was wide open and was empty.
All Ruth's pretty dresses had disappeared and there
was evidence of hasty packing.  He hurried down
the room to her trunks.  They were repacked,
strapped, and ready for shipment.  He stooped
to peer at the tags.
</p>

<p>
The trunks had come to the hotel, of course,
marked with Ruth's maiden name and Pinewood.
The man's eyes bulged&mdash;he uttered a hoarse cry.
These lines were crossed out and in their stead and
in a woman's upright handwriting he saw: "Mrs. John
B. White, New York."  Ruth had repacked
the boxes ready for their return by the express
company.
</p>

<p>
Ryder turned swiftly to the bed chamber, his
heart thumping so that he well nigh choked.  The
door of the inner room was open.  He crept to it
and looked in.  It was empty.
</p>

<p>
"She's gone!  She's run away!" muttered the
horrified man.  "What&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;"  His words
ceased and he dashed for the corridor.  He
understood at last.  She had gone away with White!
This was his firm belief.
</p>

<p>
Right here it would have been well if John Ryder
had recalled the observation of Miss Solomons:
"You're just a particular blamed fool!"
</p>

<p>
He did not stop to question the reasonableness of
this idea that had shot across his brain and seared
it.  Ruth had gone.  Her trunks were tagged with
that man's name&mdash;<i>with her own name</i>.  He saw
it all now in a flash.  She had married him while
yet she was another man's wife.  That man was
John B. White, and he had followed them to
Pinewood Inn and demanded that she return to him.
</p>

<p>
As Ryder rushed out into the corridor he came
upon the chambermaid he had tipped so liberally
that morning.  His trembling lips formed the
instant words:
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen my wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Ryder!  I saw her some time ago&mdash;going
out."
</p>

<p>
"You mean she was leaving the hotel?"
</p>

<p>
"She was dressed for traveling&mdash;yes, sir.  Just
as she was dressed when she came last evening.
Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Ryder brushed by and started for the stairs.
Ruth was attempting to get away with White on
that two o'clock train.  There might still be time
for him to catch it.  If ever hell was brewed in a
man's heart it was in the heart of John Ryder at
this moment.
</p>

<p>
Somebody spoke his name behind him.  A swift
glance showed him the motherly face of Mrs. Brack.
She seemed desirous of speaking to him, but Ryder
could stop for nothing now.  He hurried on
without a word of reply.
</p>

<p>
He reached the head of the flight and started
down.  There were several men at the desk, but
Ryder brushed through them and leaned forward
to speak confidentially to George.
</p>

<p>
"Does that train leave Barr, on the main line, at
just two o'clock?" he asked the clerk.
</p>

<p>
"Two-thirteen, Mr. Ryder," answered George.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!"  Ryder turned to make his way to
the door.  He was confronted by a stranger who
put an authoritative hand upon his breast and
pushed him back.
</p>

<p>
"This is the gentleman, is it?" the stranger said to
the clerk.  "This is John Ryder?"
</p>

<p>
"That's my name&mdash;yes," snapped Ryder.  "I'm
in a hurry.  I can't talk to you now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you'll have to wait till your hurry's
over, Mr. Ryder," said the man.  "I'm the sheriff's
deputy.  I understand you are the man who stole
two cars of coal from the Lossing Soap Company.
I've got to detain you, sir."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
AN OUTLAW IN FACT
</h3>

<p>
Now at this particular moment John Ryder
wished to be detained less than ever before in his
life.  He had but half an hour in the clear to reach
the Barr railroad station in any case.  White and
Ruth had already got a good start of him.  As far
as he knew there might not be another train to New
York over the main line until night; and surely not
on the branch from Pinewood until nine o'clock.
</p>

<p>
Sheriff or no sheriff, he made a break for the
door of the hotel.  The officer ran with him and
there was a squabble right in the foyer.
</p>

<p>
"You can't do this, Mr. Ryder!" exclaimed the
deputy sheriff.  "You're arrested!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll show you what I can do!" declared John
Ryder with emphasis, and swung for the officer's
jaw.  The blow landed and it did him good.  Not
the sheriff, but Ryder himself.
</p>

<p>
This quarrel took his mind for the moment off
the thoughts that had nearly crazed him.  He burst
through the door, banged it in the sheriff's face, and
ran for the inlet.
</p>

<p>
Before he reached the waterside he heard the
hue and cry behind him.  But there was at least one
boatman alert.
</p>

<p>
"Dodging a board bill, Mister?" exclaimed this
individual.  "Well!  I wouldn't wonder if they'll
all be doing that.  They tell me they shut off the
heat and lights on you all last night.  Gimme two
dollars and I'll put you across."
</p>

<p>
Here was a fellow just as crooked as John Ryder
needed at that moment, and the latter leaped into
the boat which was thrust out into the tide.  Down
to the shore plowed the deputy sheriff bawling for
them to come back.
</p>

<p>
"I'm deafer than an adder," said the boatman,
grinning up into John Ryder's face.  "What does
he say?"
</p>

<p>
"He seems anxious about the weather," said John
Ryder grimly.  "He's got another boat.  Two men
in it.  They'll beat you."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  Tom Crane and Andy Meyers.  That old
punt of theirs is like punk.  If we should run into
it, Mister, my prow would cut her right down to
the water-line."
</p>

<p>
"An extra five dollars for you if you do it," the
passenger snapped, his jaw set and ugly.  "But
don't pick 'em up.  The tide isn't dangerous here, is
it?"
</p>

<p>
"They kin near wade ashore," agreed the boatman
and began to hold back that the pursuing boat
would be sure to overtake them.
</p>

<p>
"Sit tight and keep your mouth shut," said the
boatman.  "The less said the better, as the old
woman remarked when she married the deaf and
dumb husban'."
</p>

<p>
The deputy sheriff, holding a handkerchief to
his jaw, was shouting commands that Ryder's boatman
did not in the least heed.  But the latter let
the other boat come right up on them.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get ye!" shouted the angry officer.  "I'll
jail you for this!  Hi! look out, you numbskull!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder's man swerved his heavy boat around
suddenly.  It was aimed directly for the leaky punt.
Crash!  The collision half drove the officer's craft
under water and she began to settle at once.
</p>

<p>
"Hi!  You'll drown us!" yelled one of the other
boatmen.
</p>

<p>
"Sho, you ain't nowheres near to the channel,"
said Ryder's man.  "It ain't neck deep to shore&mdash;from
where you came.  You fellers kin both swim,
and if the sheriff can't, let him sink.  I ain't got no
use for him, anyway."
</p>

<p>
Later he explained that this officer had come the
week before and searched his house for liquor.
</p>

<p>
"Thought I kept a blind pig, he said," chuckled
the boatman.  "But I don't.  Jest the same, if he'd
looked down our well&mdash;&mdash;  Well! if you ever come
back here and want a good drink of licker, look
me up.  I always have enough for my friends."
</p>

<p>
Ryder took the extra pair of oars at this point and
aided in rowing the boat to the other side of the
inlet.  He paid his helper and started for the
station in a rattling old car.  There was no other
vehicle to be obtained.  Just before they sighted
the railroad he heard the train whistle.
</p>

<p>
Although he knew he could not make the train,
he went on down into the town and to the station.
</p>

<p>
The two-thirteen had pulled out some time before
he stepped upon the platform.  John Ryder went
directly to the ticket window and asked the clerk:
</p>

<p>
"You sold tickets for this last train to New
York?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Coolly and carefully Ryder described White's
appearance and that of his own wife.  "I want to
catch up with these people," he explained, "and I
do not know whether they went on this train, or
on one in the other direction."
</p>

<p>
In secret his heart was lacerated by the very
words he used in describing Ruth.  Yet he must
learn if she had actually gone with White.
</p>

<p>
The clerk seemed to remember White clearly.
The man had paced the platform constantly until
the train arrived.
</p>

<p>
"Watching to see if I was following them,"
thought Ryder.  Then aloud: "And the woman?"
</p>

<p>
"She wore a veil&mdash;one o' those auto veils.  I
didn't see her face.  But she was the only woman
who left by that train."
</p>

<p>
"Not with the man?"
</p>

<p>
"They did not appear to be together."
</p>

<p>
Ryder nodded.  He had gained complete control
of himself now.  He wrote a long telegram to
the supervisor of this division of the railroad, and
the answer came so quickly that those about the
railroad office were startled.  A special train was
ordered started from the Junction for Mr. John
Ryder and would arrive about three o'clock.  It
would have right of way going north.
</p>

<p>
Ryder paced the platform and chewed his cigar.
John B. White had paced this platform, too.  Whatever
White's thoughts had been, John Ryder's were
as black and as terrible as ever man had meditated
upon.
</p>

<p>
He knew what he would do to White if he caught
him.  No matter what the guilt of his wife&mdash;or the
woman who had posed as his wife for a few
hours&mdash;Ryder was very sure that White was the more
guilty.  He was as ruthless an outlaw at this
moment as ever a twentieth century business man
could be.
</p>

<p>
The special backed in.  It stopped about ten
seconds, for Ryder was the only person to board it.
Then on toward the city for which the two guilty
creatures he was following had bought tickets.
They might have bought them for New York as a
blind; but Ruth's trunks were plainly marked for
that city.
</p>

<p>
A baggage car and smoker and some official's
private car made up the special train.  John Ryder's
name was a power with the officials of this road
if he cared to use it.  And it was of his name that
he thought, sitting shrugged down in the leather
covered lounge and watching the autumn landscape
fly past.
</p>

<p>
He remembered what he had tried to make his
name stand for during the years he had been working
up to his present business pinnacle.  He came of
unblemished stock.  His father had been an honest
man.  His mother, the memory of whom had ever
been an inspiration to him, had been a beautiful
woman both in person and character.
</p>

<p>
He had given her ring&mdash;her wedding ring, hallowed
by being worn on the finger of a pure and
gentle wife&mdash;into the keeping of one who, he now
believed, did not value the sacred character of the
emblem.
</p>

<p>
His wife&mdash;&mdash;  Well! she <i>was</i> his wife!  He had
married her legally!  He tried to push any other
thought down.
</p>

<p>
Yet, suppose she had no right to marry him?
That was the awful thought that rankled like a
barbed arrow in his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. John B. White," written under the erased
"Ruth Mont" on the trunk tags seemed to clinch
Ryder's suspicions first aroused by White's actions
and words.
</p>

<p>
Was Ruth a bigamist without having intended the
crime?  Had she been married in England and,
for some reason, supposed her husband dead?
Was there something shameful connected with this
White and her association with him that had
spurred her to try to hide her former marriage from
Ryder.
</p>

<p>
What manner of woman was she?  Was her
sweetness and innocence all assumed?  She had
seemed to John Ryder until this terrible thing had
arisen, to be good and pure&mdash;in every way a
desirable character.
</p>

<p>
Of course, she might be vain.  Her consideration
of the offer of Sam Marks to put her on the stage
might prove that frailty.  An actress!  Was there
an explanation in that thought?  Had she been
acting all along?  Had the story she told him on
shipboard been a tissue of falsehoods?  Was her
apparent fondness for him born of her ability to
simulate emotions and feelings that she did not
really possess?
</p>

<p>
Good heavens! was it all a part of a plot, perhaps,
to link his name&mdash;the name of John Ryder&mdash;with
the stage career of a vaudeville actress?  Was
this the explanation of it all?
</p>

<p>
And what of John B. White?  What of Ruth's
apparent fear of him?  Could any woman so assume
the attitude and look of terror?  On the other
hand, could her appearance of loving Ryder be
likewise assumed?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there flashed into his mind the memory
of how Ruth looked&mdash;what she had said, indeed&mdash;when
she thought he had been taken ill in the hotel
office late the previous night.  He saw her again
as she came madly down the hotel corridor and
flung herself into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"She thought it was I who had been taken sick.
That I know.  My God!  What mystery is here?
The girl loves me&mdash;deeply, sincerely, truly.  I
cannot doubt it.  Whether she has a right to do so or
not, she <i>does</i> love me.
</p>

<p>
"Then, why has she gone away with that man?
What dreadful hold does he have upon her?  Is
she beside herself?  Her words suggest an aberrant
mind.  I should be with her now.  That White is
a villain.  And whatever his right, even if it is
backed by law, shall I give up the woman I love and
who loves me to any other man on earth?"
</p>

<p>
And as though in answer to this question a
repetition of Miss Solomons' last observation to him
flashed into John Ryder's mind:
</p>

<p>
"You're just a particular blamed fool.  That's
what <i>you</i> are!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
THE NAME ON THE BILLBOARD
</h3>

<p>
Ryder arrived in New York after dark.  He did
not go to his rooms, for he feared if he did so his
presence would become known to some of his
friends and he would be obliged to make explanations.
</p>

<p>
When the taxicab deposited him, baggageless, at
the hotel he selected, he noted the variegated lights
of a drugstore across the street.  He went into it
before entering the hotel and shoved a well-wrinkled
prescription across the counter to the clerk.  The
latter raised his brows.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to sleep tonight," John Ryder said
quietly.  "You will see Dr. Harmstick's name
clearly written on that prescription.  He is my
family physician.  Here is my card."
</p>

<p>
He got the drug, and, as soon as a room was
assigned to him, took the medicine and went to bed.
He could not have slept without the dose, and that
took effect in a short time.  But, superinduced by
drugs as it was, his sleep was not refreshing.
However, his mind was clear and his body alert and
vigorous when he arose on Sunday morning.
</p>

<p>
He sent a boy to skirmish for clean linen and a
fresh tie, and made himself presentable before
going down for a bit of breakfast.  He had eaten
practically nothing the day before, and while he ate
now he tried to plan his future course of action.
</p>

<p>
Future!  Why, the word held nothing for him
but the promise of continued pain and shame.  John
Ryder of spotless name had given that name into
the keeping of a woman who was unworthy of
it&mdash;whether she had intentionally flouted him or not,
this fact seemed to be established.  The newspapers
must soon learn the story of his marriage fiasco.
It would be blazoned forth for the whole world to
read.
</p>

<p>
He would be a marked man.  John Ryder, the
man who had married a woman offhand, without
knowing anything about her!  At least, he had
known her but seven days.  And she had run away
from him with another man!
</p>

<p>
It would be a nice bit for the scandal mongers.
It would be something he could never live down.
Every man with whom he did business hereafter
would be saying to himself while in Ryder's presence:
</p>

<p>
"There must be something the matter with this
fellow.  They say his wife ran away from him the
day after they were married."
</p>

<p>
Yet, even these thoughts were not the bitterest
in his soul.  Higher than the shame of having his
trouble publicly known and discussed, rose the fact
that he had lost the treasure to which his heart
clung.
</p>

<p>
Ruth was the one woman in the world whom he
had ever, or could ever, love.  He felt it&mdash;he knew
it!
</p>

<p>
Short as their acquaintance had been, Ryder
knew that he loved Ruth as he should never be
able to love another woman.  He had thought he
loved her when he had first seen her on the deck
of the <i>Minnequago</i>; but since their marriage&mdash;since
the old clergyman had pronounced them man
and wife&mdash;a deeper and more tender feeling for his
girlish bride had grown in his mind and heart.
</p>

<p>
On shipboard, coming over, she had merely been
a beautiful creature&mdash;a woman of heart and mind
and of fine physique&mdash;who attracted his admiration
and fired his passion.
</p>

<p>
Once bound, as he supposed legally and holily to
Ruth Mont, his love for her had taken on a deeper
meaning.  He was not a man who philosophized
much, or who catechised his own motives or
thoughts; but he knew that a subtle change had
taken place in his feelings toward the woman even
before the minister had joined their hands.
</p>

<p>
It had been half pique and half determination to
obtain his own desire that had made him write that
peremptory note to Miss Mont before the
<i>Minnequago</i> docked.  It grated upon him to think of
a man like Marks bearing off such a prize, even in a
sordid business transaction.
</p>

<p>
But the instant he had seen Ruth waiting for
him when he landed&mdash;the moment she had put her
hands into his&mdash;the instant she had whispered: "I
will marry you," a greater love had leaped into
full and glowing life in John Ryder's bosom.
</p>

<p>
It was no longer a matter of mutual attraction,
or the charm of her beautiful face and figure, or
her mental attributes that held him captive.  From
that moment of their meeting on the dock his heart
knew her heart; they had become one.
</p>

<p>
And this knowledge, which he could not scorn or
overlook despite all that had happened since, made
the darker part of the puzzle.  Had he not been sure
of his love and of her love, he could have understood
in part how she had come to leave him and go
with this other man.
</p>

<p>
For he could not accept the suggestion that all
her sweetness and sheer happiness as a bride was
merely a pose.  That, as an actress, she had
simulated a part.  No, the woman did not live, he
believed, who could so befool him.
</p>

<p>
He gazed out of the restaurant window at the
church parade on the broad Fifth Avenue walk,
and with eyes that saw more than the passing
throng.  Two or three couples went by whom he
knew&mdash;men and their wives going home after service.
</p>

<p>
They suggested domesticity, companionship, the
best there is for human beings in this old world of
ours.  He realized what he had lost&mdash;aye, what he
had merely grasped at only to have the treasure
snatched from him by this cruel turn of fate.
</p>

<p>
Later he went out and wandered about somewhat
aimlessly.  Not that he expected to find either of
the two people he was looking for.  They would
not be in the Sunday street crowd.  And yet he
could not help looking into the faces of those he
met with keen scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
He could not easily set on foot any serious search
for Ruth and White on Sunday.  Nor was he sure
he wished to.  The thought of bringing the police
or even private detectives into the case horrified
him.  Yet, was he to lose Ruth without lifting a
hand to win her back?
</p>

<p>
All day long John Ryder weltered in the waters
of indecision.  Should he seek Ruth through the
regular police channels?  Should he let matters run
their own course?  This was a new state of mind
for the determined, decisive business man.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere over on the West Side, about seven
o'clock he dropped in at a restaurant to dine.
Afterward he wandered slowly down the broad and busy
avenue that lends itself the airs of Broadway after
dark, jostled by the crowds, without a person to
speak to and desirous indeed of no companionship.
</p>

<p>
He came to a theater before which was a huge
billboard that advertised mockingly "Sacred Concert,"
following which was a long list of vaudeville
turns.  Many of the crowd turned in here.  There
were speculators at the door hawking tickets, and a
little eddy of people held up John Ryder.  His eye
caught, altogether by accident it would seem, in
flaring red type, the following announcement:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
  SPECIAL ATTRACTION<br>
<br>
  First Appearance<br>
  of<br>
  ENGLAND'S MOST FAMOUS ENTERTAINER<br>
<br>
  MISS MONT<br>
<br>
  Imitator and Comédienne<br>
<br>
  Under the sole management of Mr. Sam Marks<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Seeing that he was attracting attention, Ryder
moved away.  People were looking into his face
curiously.  He felt his heart pounding as though it
would burst through the shell of his chest.  Rage
blinded him.  Despair shook him through every
fibre of his being.
</p>

<p>
The half darkness of a narrower thoroughfare
offered him shelter.  The horror and shame of his
position well nigh leveled John Ryder's pride with
the ground.
</p>

<p>
He saw what it all meant now.  There could be,
he thought, no further doubt or mistake.  She had
intended to do this from the first.  Marks had
doubtless put her up to it.  The scandal of her
having married Ryder and left him after twenty-four
hours&mdash;on some trumped up charge of course&mdash;would
give her an amount of free advertising
such as no vaudeville actress could resist!
</p>

<p>
The story was already in the papers.  John
Ryder could not doubt it.  His friends were laughing
at his predicament.  And how coolly, and with
what utter heartlessness, had the game been played
upon him.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless the woman had been under contract
with Marks when the ship left the other side.  Ryder
had foolishly showed her that he was in love with
her.  Between them, Marks and the girl had hatched
this plot.
</p>

<p>
And who was White?  The answer was easy.
</p>

<p>
He was some poor actor whom Marks had hired to
impersonate a wronged lover or husband, whichever
might best fit the needs of the case.  His
following them to the Pinewood Inn had been for the
purpose of creating a scene that would separate the
newly wedded couple.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Judson's illness had precluded the necessity
for that scene.  Fate had played into the hands of
the heartless jade; and when the game had gone
far enough for her purpose, she had run away and
returned to New York to fill this, her initial
engagement before an American public.
</p>

<p>
He even understood now about those pretty
frocks she had worn.  Of course they were a part
of a stage wardrobe Miss Mont already possessed.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts all but turned John Ryder's brain.
He found himself after a time back at the entrance
to the theater.  But he could not have told how he
got there.  One of the ticket speculators assailed
him.
</p>

<p>
"Best seat in the house, boss.  Right down front
on the side.  Two bucks.  See the whole show."
</p>

<p>
"When does Miss&mdash;Miss Mont come on?"
</p>

<p>
"Nine-thirty."
</p>

<p>
"Is she&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She's a corker!  She had her try-out before the
manager and a crowd of newspaper sharps this
morning, and she's a scream.  They'll put out the
S.R.O. signs on her for the rest of the week&mdash;you
take it from me."
</p>

<p>
Ryder bought the seat and passed in at the orchestra
entrance of the theater.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
IN THE PART OF THE INJURED HUSBAND
</h3>

<p>
The blaze of lights, the music, the rustle of the
audience, all affected Ryder but slightly.  He walked
to his seat as one might walk in a dream.  There
seemed little tangible to him in his surroundings, or
in the people he brushed past.
</p>

<p>
When he had seated himself the usher leaned over
and whispered to him to remove his hat.  He sat in
his overcoat, staring straight before him with glassy,
unwinking eyes.
</p>

<p>
A painted curtain was dropped, and between it
and the footlights two men appeared who went
through some sort of act.  Ryder never knew
what it was; nor did he appreciate the several turns
that followed this act.
</p>

<p>
Ryder found a program in his hand, and he began
to look through it for his wife's name.  Then
he remembered that it could not be there, for Marks
must have arranged for her appearance here on
Saturday.  She could not be a feature of the regular
Sunday bill.
</p>

<p>
Ryder suddenly felt a great thankfulness for this
fact.  Undoubtedly the only places where Miss
Mont's name appeared were on the billboard and
in the newspaper advertisements.
</p>

<p>
It came into his troubled mind that he was in
a position to put an effectual stop to his wife's being
advertised further as a public entertainer.  His
brain began to work clearly along this line.
</p>

<p>
She was either legally his wife, or a bigamist.
In either case, if he kept his head, he would have
the whip-hand.
</p>

<p>
If she acknowledged the legality of their
marriage, then the law would give him control over
her movements&mdash;to an extent at least.  Until she
instituted proceedings for a separation she must
obey him.
</p>

<p>
If the marriage had been a farce because of a
former marriage on her part, then his hold upon her
would be stronger still.  If she refused to retire
from the stage and live in seclusion, he would
prosecute her and put her in jail.
</p>

<p>
This thought gave him untold satisfaction for
the moment; then it horrified him.  His
wife&mdash;Ruth&mdash;the woman he loved&mdash;in jail!
</p>

<p>
What an awful experience it would be for her.
Her tender body to recline on a hard cot and be
subjected to the strict rules of a prison, and to exist
on jail fare!
</p>

<p>
Then he hardened his heart.  She was no wife
of his&mdash;only in name in any case.  She had cajoled
him and fooled him and ruined him.  She should be
made to suffer as he was suffering now.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly awoke to a stir in the audience.
The orchestra burst forth into a new melody and
the crowd began to applaud.  Who were they welcoming?
</p>

<p>
Ryder raised his eyes from the program which
was merely a blur of names to him and looked
straight into the face of the woman who had come
from the wings and was now bowing an
acknowledgment to her welcome.  It was "Miss Mont,
England's most famous entertainer."
</p>

<p>
For an instant he believed she was looking
straight at him&mdash;that she must see and give him
some sign of greeting.  He forgot the glare of the
footlights in the actor's eyes which makes the
entire auditorium a magnified blur of faces and
forms, and seldom allows the person on the stage
to descry clearly a particular face in the audience.
</p>

<p>
His eyes devoured her as though he had never
seen her before.  She was neither the woman she
had seemed aboard the <i>Minnequago</i>, nor as she had
seemed in their suite at the Pinewood Inn.
</p>

<p>
Plainly dressed aboard ship, the beauty of her
face and figure had been suggested rather than
displayed.  It was her brightness of mind that had
most deeply impressed John Ryder during the
voyage.
</p>

<p>
Afterward, during their short wedded intercourse,
her sweetness of disposition and lovely
personality had charmed and held him in her toils.
How sweet she had looked in the dressing sack
which revealed her neck and arms, bustling about
the room unpacking her trunks.
</p>

<p>
And now this was still another woman&mdash;a third
personality.  The beauty of face and form was
enhanced by her costume; but it was a cold and
formal beauty; not the living, breathing, loving
creature whom he had folded in his arms.  Nor did
she seem the same woman he had talked and walked
with on the steamship's deck.
</p>

<p>
This was Miss Mont in her public character&mdash;Miss
Mont, the actress&mdash;a woman living for the
show and applause of the stage.
</p>

<p>
She swept to the center of the stage in a trailing
robe which was cut to display the line of her figure
to perfection and which likewise left bare her
neck and shoulders and her graceful arms.
</p>

<p>
She wore no ornament.  She needed none.  Ryder
noted, even, that she no longer wore the fine gold
chain and the locket which had so stirred his doubts
and jealousy two days before.
</p>

<p>
She made another graceful courtesy and began
her act.  That she was troubled with diffidence&mdash;with
actual stage fright&mdash;there could be little doubt.
But some entertainers never get over that feeling
on first appearance, so it did not disprove Ryder's
belief that she was well trained in her art.
</p>

<p>
Her methods were natural and did not smell of
the stage; nevertheless Ryder was unconvinced.
No woman who had not had long training could
have acted the part Miss Mont had played at the
Pinewood Inn.  Why, <i>this</i> was an utterly different
woman!
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," she said, and her voice
thrilled John Ryder where he sat with his burning
gaze fixed on her face, "I am to imitate certain
well-known actors and actresses whose peculiarities
and oddities are more or less familiar to you, as
they are to me.
</p>

<p>
"As this is my first visit to America, I cannot
imitate your own local celebrities&mdash;only such of
the profession as may have come to England and
whom I have seen in London.  For instance, I
will try to imitate"&mdash;here she named a musical
comedy celebrity who had made a hit on both sides
of the Atlantic&mdash;"as she sings her most popular
song in 'The Bridal Bell.'"
</p>

<p>
Instantly the transformation that took place in
Miss Mont's attitude and facial expression carried
the house by storm.  Before she opened her lips to
sing a line of the ditty that had been so popular in
"The Bridal Bell," she looked the woman she
imitated to the life.
</p>

<p>
Ryder was actually startled.  He remembered
that once, in a spirit of fun, while aboard ship, Miss
Mont had roguishly imitated the peculiarities of
a fellow-passenger for his private amusement.  He
had not encouraged her, because he thought it
savored too much of the very thing he desired to
shield her from&mdash;the stage.  Ah, why had not his
eyes been opened then to what manner of woman
she was?
</p>

<p>
Yet during the few hours she had been with him
at the Pinewood Inn she had attempted nothing of
this kind.  Nothing in her speech or actions then
had suggested the theater.  What a consummate
actress this wretched woman was!
</p>

<p>
The applause of the crowd encouraged her.  She
did not undertake anything very difficult; but she
filled her seventeen minutes acceptably; and with
her beauty and personal charm there was little
doubt that her act would be a hit.
</p>

<p>
Her popularity with this audience did anything
but please Ryder.  The more the crowd applauded
the more bitter were his feelings, and the deeper
was the pain he suffered.
</p>

<p>
How could he ever drag this woman off the stage
after such a reception?  Both she and her manager
would fight to thwart his attempt to close her
career.  Yet he had money&mdash;much money.  Marks
could be bought out, he felt sure; but other
managers would realize that in Miss Mont there was a
fortune.
</p>

<p>
It was while these bitter feelings rankled in his
mind that she came back to bow her acknowledgment
for the applause that followed her encore.
Her gaze swept the side of the house where Ryder
sat as she went off again and once out of direct
range of the footlights, she saw his face.
</p>

<p>
He saw her start, pale, and then flush underneath
the grease-paint that stained her cheeks.  She
knew him.
</p>

<p>
Ryder rose from his seat and walked uncertainly
up the aisle.  Several people departed after her act,
and his doing so was not conspicuous.  At the door
he stopped a man and asked him where the stage
exit of the theater was located.  The man grinned
at him and said:
</p>

<p>
"Round on the other street."  Then to his friend
he added quite loud enough for Ryder to hear: "A
hard-hit Johnny I should say.  The Mont has
certainly made good with him."
</p>

<p>
Ryder flushed.  He could have turned and struck
the man down.  It was his wife who the fellow had
intimated would be an attraction for "stage-door
Jonnies."
</p>

<p>
He found the stage entrance and the usual Cerberus
on guard.  His entrance was at first denied.
For a moment the maddened man was tempted to
rush in past the doorkeeper and demand to see his
wife of the first person he met.  Better judgment
prevailed.  It was dark enough in the entry for
the doorkeeper to miss his passion-distorted face.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't nobody allowed inside, Mister," the man
said.
</p>

<p>
"I've a friend, Miss Mont&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let's have your card and I'll get it back to her,"
said the man whose hand itched for a quarter.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't a card; but I wish to see Miss Mont.
I want to surprise her, you know."  The crisp
banknote dropped into the man's hand.  "She will be
surprised to see me."
</p>

<p>
"Whew!" whistled the guard, seeing the figure
on the bill.  "I guess you are all right.  I ain't
looking at you, anyhow, boss," and he turned his back
deliberately upon Ryder.
</p>

<p>
The latter darted past him and up the half-darkened
passage to those regions back of the scenes
which so bewilder the ordinary visitor.  But Ryder
well knew how to gain his goal.
</p>

<p>
He seized the first stagehand he met, crushed
another banknote into his hand and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Show me Miss Mont's dressing-room.  I am
an old friend&mdash;from the other side."
</p>

<p>
"Number Three.  Here this way!" said the stagehand.
He, too, was moved by the size of the tip
he received.  He led Ryder to the door of the
dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
Without knocking, the injured husband opened
the door and stepped swiftly into the box-like little
apartment.  The woman was sitting before the
table and glass, removing the last traces of her
makeup.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" she asked without turning her
head.  Evidently she thought somebody had
knocked, and Ryder stood at such an angle that she
could not easily see him in the mirror.  She had
removed her stage costume and sat in her petticoat
and with frankly-bared shoulders and arms.
</p>

<p>
Ryder breathed heavily; the sight of her satin
skin and beautifully molded neck and arms almost
staggered him.  He remembered how Ruth had
looked for the single moment he had seen her in
similar undress in their bedroom at the Pinewood
Inn.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Mr. Marks?" cried Miss Mont.
"Wait a moment."
</p>

<p>
She rose swiftly, half turning, and Ryder found
his voice.
</p>

<p>
"It is not Marks, Ruth; nor yet your Mr. White.
It is I."
</p>

<p>
She uttered a little scream, but it was not a cry
of recognition.  As she swung fully around to face
him she exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"How dare you come in here?  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
Then she really saw his strained and passion-wrung
features and cried in startled amazement:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ryder!  I thought I saw you out front."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And now I'm here," said Ryder bitterly.
"Is there anything so astonishing in that?  Where
else should I be?  A man can scarcely be said to
intrude when he enters his wife's dressing-room."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;  What do you mean?" she
gasped, shrinking away from his vicinity.  She
quickly snatched up the nearest garment and flung
it about her shoulders.  "This is cruel of you,
Mr. Ryder.  Do leave me until I dress."
</p>

<p>
"Pah!  Why so prudish?  Am I not your husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Husband?  What do you say?  Is the man
mad?" murmured the woman.  "I&mdash;I am not your
wife, Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"And that may be true, too," he agreed, wetting
his lips before he could speak.  The fires of an
inward fever seemed burning him up.  "That may be
true," he pursued.  "So much the worse for you
then, Ruth.  For by the living God! if you have
tricked me in that, too, you shall suffer for it as a
bigamist."
</p>

<p>
"Tricked you?" cried she, with sudden heat, and
standing more erect before the angry man.  "I did
not trick you.  If either of us deserves the accusation
of trickster it is you.  But a woman is helpless
if a man makes a fool of her.  Had you been
the gentleman I thought you, however, you would
have told me you had changed your mind and found
that the affection you declared you had for me was
merely a passing fancy."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" he shouted.  "Don't taunt me
that way, woman!  I&mdash;who loved you devotedly,
who would do anything for you, who showed you
my heart laid bare!  And you dare accuse me of
fickleness?
</p>

<p>
"A dozen suspicious acts of yours I overlooked
while we were at the hotel together.  I refused to
believe my <i>wife</i> guilty of any thought or act that
might suggest infidelity."
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking about?  You are mad, man!"
</p>

<p>
"Mad?  Perhaps I am.  I know I shall be before
long," groaned the tortured man.  "You took my
name&mdash;whether you had a right to do so or not,
you know&mdash;and you cast it back in scorn, as though
it were a small thing for a man to give his name to
a woman."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>are</i> mad!" repeated the woman.  "How
dare you say I married you?"
</p>

<p>
Ryder staggered back against the door.  He
glared at her.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;  Do you deny it?  You may
have another husband; but you married me.  Either
you are my legal wife, or you have committed a
crime which the American laws shall punish.  See!"  He
tore open his coat, dragged out his wallet, and
displayed the marriage certificate before her startled
eyes.  "Deny that name&mdash;deny that signature&mdash;if
you can!"
</p>

<p>
She bent forward, devouring the paper with her
gaze.  Then suddenly she caught her breath and,
with one hand at her bosom as though to stifle its
throbbing, she arose to her full height and faced
him.
</p>

<p>
"I do deny&mdash;both.  That is not my handwriting.
And my name is <i>Rose</i> Mont," she said.
</p>

<p>
The shout of demoniacal laughter that burst from
Ryder's lips and the contortion of his face were
terrible.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think <i>that</i> will work, woman?  Do you
think you can dodge the law on so slight a pretext
as a false name and disguised handwriting?  You
are my wife, and by heaven I'll take you from this
place by force if you will not go with me peaceably!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
"WHO IS MY WIFE?"
</h3>

<p>
Miss Mont sank slowly into her chair, still staring
at the writhing features of the man who claimed
to be her husband.  Insanity had been her first
thought; but the agony and passion displayed by
John Ryder taught her that he was suffering as no
maniac could suffer.
</p>

<p>
His words had the ring of truth that could not be
ignored.  He claimed her as his bride, and so
confident was his belief in her identity as the woman
he had married that her own counter knowledge
was almost shaken.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ryder," she said at last and in almost a
whisper, "sit down on that trunk yonder.  Let me
talk to you.  Yes, sit down!  You are between me
and the door; I cannot escape."
</p>

<p>
Her quiet speech helped to bring him to his
senses.  He had been threatening her with the
vehemence he might have used to a man.  Red
shame dyed his cheek.  His manner suddenly
subsided.  He obeyed her.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ryder, I am not your wife," she said slowly,
looking at him with her truthful eyes.  She was the
woman now she had seemed aboard the <i>Minnequago</i>.
"No!  I do not mean that," as she saw a
wicked expression come into his face.  "I have
neither intentionally, nor unintentionally wronged you.
</p>

<p>
"Had I been convinced that I could&mdash;could learn
to love you as a wife should and had married you,
I would have done nothing which you in any way
could construe as an attempt to bring disgrace upon
your name.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!  You are in a maze yet.  You believe I
am splitting hairs.  I am not."  She leaned forward
and raised her voice for emphasis.  "I am not
the woman whom you married."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he gasped starting up
again.  "Would you make me doubt my own eyes?
You sit there and coolly tell me I do not know the
woman I married&mdash;the woman whom I held in my
arms night before last&mdash;the woman who told me
over and over again, by look and word, that she
loved me?"
</p>

<p>
She had blushed vividly and for a moment covered
her face with her hands.  But she stopped him
at that point.
</p>

<p>
"That is exactly what I do tell you.  You do not
know your wife, the woman whose name is on that
marriage paper.  Look at me closely.  Come nearer.
Is there not some feature different?  Is she
truly&mdash;this other woman&mdash;so like me?"
</p>

<p>
She said it earnestly and eagerly.  She bent
toward him until her breath fanned his face and
until he could look with his troubled eyes deep into
her clear, shadowless orbs.
</p>

<p>
And then, strange as it may seem, although John
Ryder saw nothing unfamiliar in her countenance&mdash;nothing
to warn him that this was not the woman
whom he had wedded&mdash;one thing he suddenly
knew.  It was a startling discovery.  It shook him
to the very depths of his soul.
</p>

<p>
Whereas Ruth's very presence&mdash;his being near
her and in physical contact with her&mdash;had thrilled
him each time it occurred, he felt no such shock
now.  His anger had abated.  He was shaken no
more by the terrible rage under which he had
labored.  But this woman held no such influence over
him, after all, as had Ruth.  Still he was confused.
</p>

<p>
"Ruth!  Can such a thing be?" he whispered
brokenly.  "You surely <i>do</i> love me a little?"
</p>

<p>
The abjectness of his speech and the misery in
the man's face were awful.  Miss Mont covered her
face again and began to sob.
</p>

<p>
"You will not do this to me, Ruth?  I know you
must love me a little.  No woman could be to a man
what you were to me without loving him.
Whatever this shadow is that has come between us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The passion and pleading in his voice had swept
her on with him.  She was trembling violently and
her sobs were more broken.  He would have gathered
her into his arms by one sudden movement had
she not sprung to her feet and eluded his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  Stop!" she cried hoarsely.  "This is not
for me to hear!  You do not mean this for <i>me</i>!
</p>

<p>
<a id="p243"></a>
"I tell you, Mr. Ryder, I am another woman.
I am not the person you married.  I am not Ruth
Mont; I am Rose Mont&mdash;and always have been
and," she broke into passionate weeping,
"and&mdash;and&mdash;always&mdash;shall be&mdash;<i>now</i>!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-243"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-243.jpg" alt="I am another woman. I am not the person you married.">
<br>
I am another woman. I am not the person you married.
</p>

<p>
The vehemence of her emotion quelled Ryder as
nothing else had done.  She flung herself upon her
knees with her head and arms resting upon the
littered dressing table and abandoned herself to tears
which seemed to well from her very soul.
</p>

<p>
He leaned over her, not daring to touch her,
anxious, panting&mdash;altogether broken in spirit.  A
woman's tears flow easily they say; but this woman
was not by nature a crying woman.  This flood,
however, cleared her heart and mind, and she saw
and understood more clearly when her passion was
past.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, Mr. Ryder," she said at last,
recovering her seat and motioning him into his.  "This
is a wonderful thing&mdash;and a terrible thing.  Don't
look at me like that!  Please, <i>please</i> don't!  I tell
you I am not the woman you think me."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean," he said with deliberation, "that
you are not the woman I met aboard the
<i>Minnequago</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Or you are not the woman I asked to marry me
before we landed?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Mr. Ryder!  I am that woman."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you say just now you were not?"
he demanded with heat.  "I treated you fairly.
Were you not satisfied?  Was the glamor of this,"
and he indicated the makeup box and her discarded
costume in his gesture, "too much for you?  Could
any man give you more that is worth while in life
than I?  Are you of so changeable a mind that you
did not know what you really wanted?
</p>

<p>
"When I wrote you aboard ship to choose once
for all between this beastly Marks' offer of a stage
career and a position as my wife&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What letter?  What do you mean?" she cried,
darting at him suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"You know what I mean.  You answered the
letter in person when you met me on the dock."
</p>

<p>
"I received no letter from you, Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
He looked puzzled and hesitated.  "Well, what
matters it?  You met me and said you were willing
to marry me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I tell you <i>No</i>!" she cried.  "I did not meet you.
I did not say I would marry you.  And I did not
marry you."
</p>

<p>
"By heaven, woman!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
She bore him back into his seat upon the trunk
with both hands upon his shoulders.  Her face was
thrust close to his and she held him by the power
of her gaze.  But again John Ryder realized that
her nearness lacked that thrilling influence upon
him which contact with his bride had evolved.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me," she repeated impressively.  "You
have been betrayed&mdash;fooled.  Either you have
deceived yourself, or have been deliberately deceived
by others who knew well your wealth and power&mdash;the
man you are.  You millionaires are a mark for
designing persons, Mr. Ryder, as you should well
know.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot understand it all.  But this I do know:
I did not see you to speak to for all of that last
day before the ship docked.  I thought you&mdash;you
had seen the unwisdom of your course in offering
marriage to a woman like me."
</p>

<p>
She hesitated and the tears welled to her eyes
again, but by sheer force of will she drove them
back.  "I received no letter from you, Mr. Ryder;
none at all, you understand!"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I gave it to a steward."
</p>

<p>
"It was not delivered.  When we landed I did
not see you.  Stop!  Let me finish.  I was one of
the last to leave the ship.  Mrs. Gurthrie&mdash;the lady
who sat by my side at the table&mdash;you remember?
Mrs. Gurthrie was taken ill as we came up the bay.
I remained with her after we docked.  An ambulance
had to be sent for to remove her to her home.
I went with her in the ambulance before going to
the hotel Mr. Marks selected for me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What are you saying?" gasped Ryder, his face
like death.
</p>

<p>
"I am telling you the truth.  I can prove every
word I say.  A dozen witnesses&mdash;officers of the
ship, the doctor, the driver of the ambulance,
Mrs. Gurthrie herself and her husband, Mr. Marks&mdash;all
these can bear out what I say."
</p>

<p>
She thought he would faint and reaching for the
glass standing at her elbow placed the water to his
lips.  He drank it, still staring into her countenance
with fixed gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Do you understand?" she continued softly.
"Don't you <i>see</i> that I am not the woman you
married, Mr. Ryder?  I am forced to earn my living.
This way of the stage was opened to me and my
success tonight proves that I was right in accepting
the chance offered."
</p>

<p>
But, he was not listening.  He did not hear her
final words at all.  All that he really heard was this
query, repeated over and over again in his tortured
brain:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who is my wife?</i>"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
IN THE MAZE
</h3>

<p>
Both the man and the woman were shocked into
a sudden appreciation of the world outside that
box-like dressing-room by a knock on the door.  Miss
Mont rose quickly, threw off the garment with
which she had lightly covered her shoulders and
slipped into a negligee which had been hanging in
the corner.
</p>

<p>
"Who's there?" she asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, hullo!" and Sam Marks' broad face
showed at the opening door.  "Ain't you a long time
getting dressed, Miss Mont?  I got a taxi at the
door&mdash;&mdash;  Hullo!"
</p>

<p>
He saw Ryder but did not at first recognize him.
</p>

<p>
"Got a visitor?  Scuse me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You may come in," said Miss Mont sternly.
"You will recognize this gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  Well, I wouldn't, hardly.  What's the
matter with him?" asked Marks, finally identifying
Ryder.
</p>

<p>
The manager looked anxious, and he kept very
close to the door.  Miss Mont watched him
narrowly; but Ryder scarcely raised his eyes from the
floor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Marks," she said, "Mr. Ryder came
here&mdash;&mdash;  That is, he says that before we landed
from the <i>Minnequago</i> he sent me a letter to my
stateroom.  I did not receive it.  You were hovering
around me a good deal just then.  Did you happen
to see the letter?"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;<i>me</i>?  Why, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your face tells the truth if your lips cannot,"
she interrupted him sharply.  "I see that you <i>did</i>
get my letter.  Where is it?"
</p>

<p>
Marks looked foolish; yet his pig-like eyes
twinkled.  He found the hardihood to say:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I had to get your name on that contract
and I wasn't going to risk this guy butting in.
Guess you're glad now yourself.  See the hand you
got tonight?  You're going to be a knock-out."
</p>

<p>
"You scoundrel!" she said bitterly.  "You do
not know what you have done.  You would not
understand if I told you&mdash;you clod!  Can you
understand this much?  Your stealing that
letter&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!  that's rather thick, you know.  I
didn't steal it and I didn't destroy it.  I just forgot
to give it to you after taking it from the steward,"
and he grinned, bringing forth the still unopened
letter from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"You dog!  Oh, that men like you are allowed to
live!  You do things for a selfish reason, and then
can never undo the harm you have done.  Had you
killed one or both of us, your act could have been
no more brutal."
</p>

<p>
"God bless us!" gasped Marks looking fairly
frightened now.  "It ain't as bad as that.  I got you
on a contract&mdash;that's all I wanted.  What's the
matter with him?  Won't he marry you just the same?
But you'll have to fulfil the terms of my
contract."  Then he laughed a sudden sneering laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Or did somebody butt in on your game?  I saw
him walking off the dock with another queen."
</p>

<p>
Miss Mont started.  "You saw them together?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"Saw the woman?  What did she look like?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't see her face," Sam Marks said, puzzled
at her vehemence.  "I was only thinkin' just then
of the contract in my pocket."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you beast!" she exclaimed in disgust.  "Go
away.  I want to talk with Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well!  You can call names&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go!" she commanded.  "Let the taxi wait."
</p>

<p>
He slunk out of the dressing-room.  It is doubtful
if Ryder had realized his presence at all.
</p>

<p>
"Come," Miss Mont said with her hand on the
shoulder of the stunned man.  "I want you to wait
for me outside the door until I dress.  Then you
shall ride to my hotel with me.  Let me help you to
understand this&mdash;this thing."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her in a dazed way; but finally he
obeyed and went out of the room.  He was in a
maze and his intellect seemed beclouded.
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes she rejoined him and led the way
to the stage entrance where the car was in waiting.
They entered it, she gave the chauffeur the direction,
and the jouncing of the taxicab over the nearest
car track aroused Ryder to the first audible
speech he had made since the truth had sunk into
his mind.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I cannot believe it, Miss Mont.  Yet it must
be so.  How two women could look so much alike&mdash;act
so much alike!  Great heavens!  She shall suffer
for it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The woman beside him turned quickly and placed
a palm lightly upon his lips.  So like was the gesture
to Ruth's that Ryder caught his breath and sank
back in the seat, wordless again.
</p>

<p>
"Say nothing like that.  Malign no person.  Let
us learn all the truth before we judge.  Tell
me&mdash;tell me about this other woman&mdash;this Ruth."
</p>

<p>
"She&mdash;she has left me," he said sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Left you!  How&mdash;when?  No, no!  Begin at
the beginning.  Tell me all.  I will not hear a
word against her&mdash;I must not!&mdash;until I know all the
story."
</p>

<p>
This aroused John Ryder.  He looked at her
curiously.  "You are a strange woman," he said.
"Do you realize that she impersonated you?  That
I married her thinking she was you?  That&mdash;that&mdash;God
help me!  She stole from you my love, for
I <i>do</i> love her!  I <i>do</i> love her!"
</p>

<p>
Miss Mont had taken his hand in both of hers.
She sat and held it thus, looking straight ahead and
saying no word for a long minute.  Finally she
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all about it&mdash;and about her.  Keep
nothing back, Mr. Ryder.  Think of me as though I
were your sister.  And let that be no empty term,
please.  For, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"  She did not finish the
sentence but added instead: "Tell me all!"
</p>

<p>
For a few moments Ryder was silent, trying to
collect his thoughts in order to tell his story with
some clarity.  He fully realized that his thoughts
were somewhat confused, that the emotions which
had been let loose within him had, for the time
being, impaired his usual judgment, a little confused
his clear, keen mind, which ordinarily decided
matters so rapidly and so surely.
</p>

<p>
Moreover he felt, rather than reasoned out, that
in some way Miss Mont held the key to the
situation, that if she knew the whole story and knew it
accurately, she could be of help.  So he sat, pondering,
for a few moments, and again came the command:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all!"
</p>

<p>
And Ryder told her.  It was a long ride to the
hotel uptown where Miss Mont was housed and
there was time for him to relate every detail of his
experience from the moment he had landed on the
dock and met the strange woman who bore Miss
Mont's name and looked so much like her.
</p>

<p>
When the story was finished the woman beside
him turned to Ryder with tears in her voice, but
with them a note of joy, as well.
</p>

<p>
"Let me tell you something, Mr. Ryder," she
said.  "And, believe me, I would stake my life upon
it: This woman you have married loves you!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe so?" he whispered.  Then, starting
up angrily, he began to say harshly: "Love
me?  How can she and treat me so?  To run away
with that man, White&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait.  Let us know all first.  With the
confidence that you should have in your heart of her
love for you, you must not say that."
</p>

<p>
"But they left the hotel; they took the same
train."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"And what hold has he over her?  What is he
to her?  Is she my wife, or is she the wife of
another?  And where is she now?"
</p>

<p>
"Your last question is the most important," Miss
Mont said quietly.  "That is the first problem we
have to solve.  'We,' I say, for I believe I am as
much interested in finding Ruth Mont as you."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her curiously and in surprise.  But
she made no explanation, saying only:
</p>

<p>
"As for your first queries, we can only guess at
the proper answers for them.  And guessing is poor
business.  Who the man White is I cannot be sure,
of course.  But I should not be surprised if he
were the man she was really waiting for that
morning on the dock when the <i>Minnequago</i> got in."
</p>

<p>
"What?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I remember well that there was a passenger
named White aboard.  He was ill most of the time
coming over.  His stateroom was near mine.  He
was being helped ashore by one of the stewards at
the time we got Mrs. Gurthrie into the ambulance.
You say he signed 'John B. White, Rome,' on the
hotel register.  It was Rome, Italy, of course.  He
must have been out of America for years.
</p>

<p>
"If he was actually Ruth Mont's husband she
would not have gone through a marriage ceremony
with you, for she believed you to be White."
</p>

<p>
"What are you saying?" stammered the confused
Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That is the explanation, I feel sure.  You
say she picked out Pinewood for your honeymoon,
saying something about the place reminding you
both of old times.  I should think that would have
awakened you to some suspicion of the facts.  But
a man in love, I suppose, is accountable neither for
his deeds nor his words.
</p>

<p>
"It is plain, Mr. Ryder, that your wife and this
White knew each other years ago.  Perhaps they
had not met since childhood.  They have probably
corresponded; but she could not have known much
about his mature appearance.
</p>

<p>
"She was waiting for him when you landed
from the <i>Minnequago</i>.  You thought she was I.
How much we must look alike!"
</p>

<p>
"Alike?" he murmured.  "You are twins."
</p>

<p>
"No; we are not twins," she corrected him with
confidence.  "But there is a reason why we should
look and seem so much alike.
</p>

<p>
"Now, see: You came to her on the dock, and
your first question convinced her you were White.
From what you tell me it seems that she was not
sure of her own mind until she had seen you in
the flesh.
</p>

<p>
"What woman could be sure, when she had not
met her lover for years?  And," the woman's voice
broke, but she went on bravely, "for your comfort,
Mr. Ryder, let me tell you that I believe she must
have fallen in love with you on that instant of
meeting."
</p>

<p>
John Ryder was silent.  He was suddenly confronted
with a second riddle, but he had no words
in which to answer it.  Had this woman, now talking
to him so gently and impressively, been drawn
toward him, too?  What had his impetuosity done
to her, as well as to himself?  He could no longer
selfishly feel that he was the only person injured
by this tragedy of errors.
</p>

<p>
"Then," Miss Mont continued, "the knowledge
of what she had done&mdash;what a great mistake she
had made&mdash;came to her with a suddenness that was
enough to turn the woman's brain.  She had thought
herself in love all these years with one man, and
had married another!
</p>

<p>
"Put yourself in her place.  Think what an
opinion she holds of <i>you</i>.  If your heart and brain
have been seared by your trouble, think how she
must feel.  She cannot understand why you
impersonated White.  She is as much in the dark
as you were.  She must think you deliberately
befooled her.  She fled&mdash;not with White, I stake my
life upon it!&mdash;but because she was so mentally
disturbed that flight seemed the only course left
her."
</p>

<p>
"But the name&mdash;'Mrs. John B. White'&mdash;written
in her own hand upon the trunk labels?" questioned
the man.
</p>

<p>
It was dark in the taxicab.  The vehicle had
stopped at the side door of Miss Mont's hotel and
the chauffeur was impatiently waiting further orders
or the alighting of his passengers.  Ryder could
not see Miss Mont's face.
</p>

<p>
He could not see her burning blush; he could
not know of the tears flooding her eyes; he could
only hear the tremor of her voice as she whispered:
</p>

<p>
"My heart tells me, Mr. Ryder, that Ruth wrote
those lines as soon as her trunks arrived at the
hotel.  It was her new name.  She wished to see
how it looked when she wrote it on the tags!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose that&mdash;all this you have told
me&mdash;is the right explanation of this awful mystery?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so.  If she has come to this city and
is hiding from you, it is because she cannot
imagine what manner of man would usurp another's
name and place as you seem to have done."
</p>

<p>
The tone that suddenly sounded in Ryder's voice
could not be mistaken.  "I'll have the whole police
force hunting for her in the morning.  I'll turn up
the whole town to find her.  Think of it!  The poor
child running away from <i>me</i>.  When I love her so
and am so sure she loves me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Miss Mont stopped him.  "I&mdash;I must leave you
now," she said in a muffled voice.  "No! don't get
down.  I do not need you.  Let me know how you
succeed."  She was out of the taxicab instantly
and without a backward glance ran hastily into the
hotel.  He did not see her face again; but Ryder
knew she was struggling to keep back another
tempest of weeping.
</p>

<p>
He told the chauffeur where to drive him, and
rode back downtown.  After the storm of emotion
of the last two hours his soul was strangely peaceful
and he was even light-hearted.
</p>

<p>
The contrast between the awful uncertainty of
the riddle of his wife's actions and the confidence
he now felt that Miss Mont's explanation was the
only sane and reasonable explanation, was so great
that Ruth's disappearance seemed at this moment a
small matter indeed.
</p>

<p>
Money and patience would find her, of course.
Of the first he had plenty, thank heaven!  The last
he must cultivate as need be.
</p>

<p>
A steeple clock boomed the hour of midnight.
The third day of John Ryder's honeymoon was
ended.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
NEMESIS
</h3>

<p>
With this better understanding of the exciting
and brain-wracking incidents of these three days,
John Ryder became again his sane and businesslike
self.  Before he reached his hotel he had evolved a
plan for his future course relating to the woman he
had married by mistake.  Of course, this plan began
with the discovery of her whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
He must have some theory to work on.  He could
go to the police and ask them to send out a
description of his wife and trust to luck that some
sharp-eyed detective would see her.  That, however,
was a method which he abhorred.
</p>

<p>
If Ruth had come to New York, or if she had
gone elsewhere, John Ryder could think of just
one way in which she might be traced.
</p>

<p>
He was convinced now that she was not with
White.  Ryder had cast that unfortunate individual
into the discard entirely.  Miss Mont's explanation
of the mystery that had involved them all was so
clear that Ryder could no longer feel jealous of
John B. White.
</p>

<p>
Indeed the man might have better reason to feel
that Ryder had defrauded him.  Unintentionally
Ryder had substituted himself for White, and had
borne off the girl the latter expected to marry,
and had made her his wife.
</p>

<p>
The thing to do now was for Ryder to find her,
to explain his own course in the matter, and to
convince Ruth that she had, after all, married the
right man.
</p>

<p>
To start on this quest aright, he felt that he
must begin at the Pinewood Inn.  There was
something at Pinewood that he felt sure would aid him
in his search for his bride.  She must send for the
trunks and then he would obtain her address.
</p>

<p>
Therefore he went back to his hotel with the
intention of leaving a call for the early morning
train that would take him back to the resort.  When
he entered the hostelry and approached the desk
he was surprised to be told that a lady was waiting
for him in one of the hotel parlors.
</p>

<p>
"Been here for some time, sir.  Said she would
wait till you came in, no matter how late you were.
It must be something important, Mr. Ryder," the
clerk told him.
</p>

<p>
Ryder's heart leaped for joy.  His first thought
was that it was Ruth.  How she could have found
his hotel&mdash;what had brought her here&mdash;he did not
stop to question.  He followed the bellboy with
eager steps to the parlor where, under a dim light,
the woman sat waiting for his return.
</p>

<p>
When John Ryder strode into the room he felt
a distinct drop in the temperature of his feelings.
This might be a woman that had waited for him, but
she was dressed more like a man.  A long raincoat
wrapped her about, and a felt hat pulled down over
her ears disguised her femininity most effectually.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Solomons!" exclaimed Ryder, as the person
rose and turned toward him.
</p>

<p>
"That's who 'tis," jerked out the house detective
of the Pinewood Inn.  "I've been waiting for you,
Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
Could it be possible that she had come with some
message from Ruth, or information about her?
Ryder could not find voice enough in which to ask
her.  His silence seemed to give Miss Solomons
immense satisfaction.  Her eyes snapped, and she
waved in a commanding way the folded copy of the
novel she always carried.
</p>

<p>
"I've got you!  I told 'em I'd find you, all right.
Can't fool <i>me</i>.  You'd better come with me,
Mr. Ryder.  Don't try any capers."
</p>

<p>
"What the&mdash;&mdash;  What do you want of me?" demanded
the rapidly disillusioned Ryder.  He realized
that Miss Solomons could have come on no
sentimental mission.
</p>

<p>
"They want you back to Pinewood.  You know.
You aren't silly enough to refuse to go without
extradition papers, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;under&mdash;the&mdash;sun&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Back up!" exclaimed Miss Solomons.  "That
don't go.  You know well enough what they want
you for.  That deputy sheriff is a dunce.  You got
away from <i>him</i>; but not from me."
</p>

<p>
"But what have you got to do with the deputy's
trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"Say!  Don't fool yourself.  I'm a properly appointed
officer of the State.  That deputy fell down
on the job, but I told 'em I'd get you.  Come!"
</p>

<p>
"But what <i>for</i>?" demanded John Ryder, suddenly
becoming quiet.
</p>

<p>
"Stealin' that coal.  Thought you could get away
with two carloads of coal and nobody do nothin'
about it?"
</p>

<p>
"But," pointed out Ryder, "the coal was for the
use of the hotel, and you are an employee of the
hotel.  Where do you come into this?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm officer of the State first," said Miss Solomons
promptly.  "It was a dead open and shut robbery.
Then you attacked that poor deputy.  That's
serious.  I'm a brother officer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you mean a <i>sister</i> officer?" suggested John
Ryder gently.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  Don't get gay," advised Miss Solomons.
"I'm asking if you are going to come peaceably, or
must I make trouble for you in this ranch?"
</p>

<p>
"Where will you take me?"
</p>

<p>
"If you agree to go back quiet-like to Pinewood,
I'll take you right to the station."
</p>

<p>
"And sit there in a draughty station for five
hours or more, waiting for the first train?" he asked
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't treat a fellow that way, would
you, Miss Solomons?" he went on wheedlingly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try no soft stuff on <i>me</i>," advised the house
detective gloomily.  "I don't fall for it."
</p>

<p>
"But can't I go to bed and be called at a proper
time to make the train?"
</p>

<p>
"What's going to happen to me?" she demanded.
"Expect me to sleep on the mat outside your door?"
</p>

<p>
"But can't you go to bed, too?  Let us behave
humanlike," John Ryder urged.  "Just because you
are an officer and I am a&mdash;er&mdash;criminal, shall we
say?&mdash;we need not both be miserable.  <i>I</i> want to
sleep."
</p>

<p>
"I should worry whether you sleep or not,"
snapped the house detective.  "I haven't had much
myself lately."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Where do I bunk?" asked Miss Solomons.
</p>

<p>
"I will telephone down and secure a room for
you.  Near my own.  You may lock me in if you
like and keep the key."
</p>

<p>
"Inside room?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I can't get out by the window very easily."
</p>

<p>
"So be it!" she exclaimed.  "You're a particular
blame fool, Mr. Ryder; but not fool enough to try
to escape <i>me</i>, I guess.  Besides," she added, "here's
a note was sent to you.  Maybe it'll put you wise to
somethin'."
</p>

<p>
She handed him a sealed envelope.  Ryder's heart
leaped once and then stopped.  It was not addressed
in Ruth's handwriting, although his name
was written in a feminine hand.
</p>

<p>
He tore it open, unfolded the paper it contained,
and read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"If you are a man and love R. return
immediately.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"ALICE J. BRACK."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ryder stood holding the note for a full minute
while he regained his poise.  Who was "Alice
J. Brack?"  Not Ruth herself.  Surely there could
not be another mixup in names!
</p>

<p>
Then, of a sudden, he remembered the white-haired,
motherly-looking wife of the fire-eating
colonel.  It flashed into Ryder's mind that while
he was hurrying out of the hotel at Pinewood,
Saturday noon, Mrs. Brack had sought to speak
to him.
</p>

<p>
What did she know about his wife and the mystery
that had entangled him in its snare?  Why,
if he loved Ruth, must he return to the Pine wood
Inn?  He looked up and caught Miss Solomons
eying him with so soft a gaze that he was actually
startled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" gasped John Ryder, "is she <i>there</i>?"
</p>

<p>
The detective "came to attention" swiftly.  Her
face hardened to its usual bored expression.  She
said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about the note.  It was
given to me by the old lady.  I'm here to take you
back for stealing coal."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  All right," said John Ryder.  "I'll go."
</p>

<p>
But the detective seemed suddenly more moderate
in her demands.  "Tell you what," she said.
"I'll bunk here."
</p>

<p>
"Here in the parlor?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  'Twon't hurt <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"In one of these chairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Good's I us'ally get at night," she declared.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear young woman," protested Ryder,
"the management of the hotel won't permit anyone
to lie around in their parlors all night."
</p>

<p>
"They'll let me, I guess!  I'm a State officer.
I've got rights that don't pertain to any old person
that just happens to drop into a hotel.  Now, you
can beat it to your room.  I won't let you oversleep.
We'll make that six-fifteen train."
</p>

<p>
But John Ryder needed nobody to awaken him
at the proper hour.  He was up in good season,
and had heard nothing of Miss Solomons when he
came out of his bedchamber at half after five in
the morning.
</p>

<p>
He went to the parlor to look for her.  There
was but a single light burning, and that dimly.
The house detective of the Pine wood Inn was sound
asleep in her chair.  She had evidently succumbed
to nature while keeping what she considered proper
vigil.
</p>

<p>
The long-barreled pistol she carried had slipped
to the rug at her feet.  When Ryder stooped to
pick it up before awakening Miss Solomons, he saw
that she had dropped her "five-cent thriller" as
well.
</p>

<p>
He picked this up and unfolded the pamphlet
curiously.  He expected to find a detective story with
quite as sensational a title as Jim Howe had
suggested.  Instead, the title of the story the house
detective had been last perusing was:
</p>

<p>
"Little Laurel's Lovers; Or, Sweethearts' Paths
Made Smooth."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
JOHN RYDER FORGIVES FATE
</h3>

<p>
They might have arrived at the Pinewood Inn
earlier had not the officer and her captive been met
before they crossed the inlet to the hotel by a man
with a bandage swathing his jaw.  Ryder had
considerable trouble in identifying the deputy sheriff,
whom he had last seen struggling in the tide.
</p>

<p>
"Got him," said Miss Solomons briefly to the
deputy.  "He came back without making any
trouble."
</p>

<p>
She seemed, Ryder thought, a little sorry that she
was forced to hand him over to the mercy of the
other officer.  For that deputy did seem vindictive.
</p>

<p>
"Got a warrant, have you?" asked Miss Solomons,
as an afterthought.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know my business.  I'll get the warrant,
all right," growled the man with the bruised jaw.
</p>

<p>
"You can't arrest without a warrant on such a
charge," declared the house detective, suddenly
taking up cudgels for John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'll hold him all right.  He's been stealing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who makes the complaint?" asked the culprit
mildly.  "Of course, old fellow, I'm sorry you
obliged me to hit you.  If anything I can do will
salve your lacerated feelings&mdash;&mdash;?"  He drew out
his wallet.
</p>

<p>
"You stole that coal," growled the man, his eyes
glittering, however, when he saw the money Ryder
carried.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right!  If you insist," said John Ryder.
"But who is the complainant in the case?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the railroad, I s'pose."
</p>

<p>
"That is what you <i>suppose</i>," said the culprit.
"Now, let me tell you what I know.  The railroad
was merely the carrier.  It did not own the coal.
The railroad was neither consignor nor consignee."
</p>

<p>
"Then the coal company will prosecute."
</p>

<p>
"No, they won't.  They ship at consignee's risk.
If anybody moves in the matter it will be the actual,
legal owner of the coal.  In other words, the Lossing
Soap Company."
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?" demanded the deputy
with some heat.  "Somebody will prosecute.  You
can't get out of that."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe.  Just wait a moment, Mr. Sheriff.  I
happen to have a letter here from the Lossing Soap
Company.  It's on a private matter; but I'll show
you the letter-head.  Here, just read that aloud,"
and he tore off the printed heading of the letter and
handed it to the officer.
</p>

<p>
"'Lossing Soap Company, Capitalization&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that," interposed Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"'Rated&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Skip that.  Who's the president?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;  My goodness gracious!" gasped
the deputy.  "The&mdash;the president of the company
is&mdash;is Mr. John Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Ryder quietly.  "John Ryder.
There is only one of us, and that's me.  I may be a
fool&mdash;as Miss Solomons here says I am&mdash;but I'm
not fool enough to prosecute myself for stealing my
own coal.  You can go back and report, Mr. Deputy,
to your superior; and when you find out how much
you think that sore jaw is worth, let me know.
We'll be able to settle it out of court."
</p>

<p>
He walked on to enter a boat that had come to
transfer him across the inlet.  Miss Solomons
looked after him, and then at the deputy.  Scorn
made her voice fairly tremble as she viewed the
abashed officer up and down his length.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" he emitted, and stopped unable to go on,
and even, seemingly, to close his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Good-<i>night!</i>" muttered the house detective, and
followed John Ryder into the boat.
</p>

<p>
She kept a discreet silence all the way across the
inlet and as they walked up the path to the
Pinewood Inn.  There Ryder went immediately to the
desk, to be hailed joyfully by George.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if we aren't all glad to see you again,
Mr. Ryder!" exclaimed the clerk.  "The guests are
going to give you a testimonial banquet soon's it
can be arranged."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, George! can't you get me out
of that?  Why&mdash;why! it's preposterous!  Man
alive! you've got to nip that!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know how I can, Mr. Ryder.  When
Colonel Brack gets set on something he's hard to
change.  And then there's Pop Cudger&mdash;he's in
this, too, and he never stops to hear what any other
fellow has to say once he begins on a thing."
</p>

<p>
Ryder groaned dismally.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Giddings has arrived and is anxious to
see you," went on the clerk.  "Say!  I'm going to be
manager here in place of Bangs.  And if I make
good I'll owe it all to you," declared the grateful
young man.
</p>

<p>
"And say, your wife will be tickled to see
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What!"  Ryder for a moment lost control of
himself, but George was too full of news to notice
his emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally she'd be lonely.  She's been sticking
as close to Mrs. Brack as though the old lady was
her mother.  And the colonel is evidently dead stuck
on Mrs. Ryder.  I think he'll even forgive you,
sir," and George chuckled.
</p>

<p>
Ryder swallowed hard, and finally was able to
speak without a noticeable tremor in his voice:
</p>

<p>
"Guess it is too early to go upstairs.  Nobody
will be up yet."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Mrs. Ryder has not telephoned down for
her breakfast.  And I believe Mrs. Brack is with
her, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'em I'm here if they 'phone down," said
Ryder, and went into the breakfast room.
</p>

<p>
Before he completed his leisurely meal Mrs. Judson
swept into the room in a wonderful morning
gown.  She caught sight of Ryder, looked her
astonishment for an instant, and then advanced
down the room with the evident intention of
speaking to him.
</p>

<p>
It was rude, but Ryder would have knocked her
down had she been a man.  As he could not do
this, he deliberately turned his eyes away and
ignored her.  The cut direct could not be mistaken,
and several noticed the widow's discomfiture.
</p>

<p>
A moment later one of the bellboys brought
Ryder a note.  He tried to seem undisturbed as he
opened and read it:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR SIR:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come to me in the parlor before seeing your
wife.  She does not know yet that you have
returned.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Sincerely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ALICE J. BRACK."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He arose finally and made his way to the parlor,
with an apparent ease of manner he did not at all
feel.  It was the same room that had been the scene
of so many events on that night when Pop Cudger
and his colored retainer had guarded Van Scamp's
famous painting of "The Cheesemonger."
</p>

<p>
The tranquil countenance of the colonel's lady
seemed to John Ryder one of the most beautiful
he had ever seen.  Her smile encouraged him.  Her
first words filled him with delight:
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she is well."
</p>

<p>
He could have hugged her!  But Mrs. Brack
added gravely:
</p>

<p>
"Before I let you go up to the poor child, you
must tell me your side of the story.  All of it.  She
has trusted everything to me.  I understand her
mistakes and her misery fully.  And I tell you now
that no shadow of wrong rests upon her conduct.
Can you say as much, Mr. Ryder?
</p>

<p>
"I have promised that you shall not see her
unless you can explain satisfactorily what you have
done.  Tell me, why did you, a perfect stranger as
she declares, represent yourself to her as the man
she expected to marry and for whom she was waiting
on that dock?"
</p>

<p>
"Then Miss Mont was right!" exclaimed John Ryder.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Mont?  Do you mean your wife?"
</p>

<p>
Ryder eagerly told Mrs. Brack in detail of the
mystery of the two girls named Mont and of all
Rose Mont had surmised.  He knew now who Ruth
must be.  His listener sat enthralled until he had
completed his story.  Then she suddenly took him
by both shoulders and gave him a little shake.
</p>

<p>
"John Ryder," she said, repeating (though in a
more refined phrase) Miss Solomons' stated opinion
of his character, "John Ryder, you are a particularly
foolish man.  There is one principle of married
life which you have overlooked&mdash;it is the
foundation, indeed, of wedded happiness.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mutual confidence</i>.  If two people possess that,
happiness may come or go; that is a craft that
sails with variable winds.  But trust must remain
if wedded comradeship is to last.
</p>

<p>
"The very first thing that started suspicion in
your mind should have made you go to your wife
for an explanation.  Because you did not do this
you both have got into much sorrow and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," the woman added suddenly: "Which
of these two women do you love?  You fell in love
with that other Miss Mont on the steamship, and
asked her to be your wife.  You must have thought
you loved her.  But you met this poor child you
have married and seem to have felt no difference
in the two.  And yet there must be a difference&mdash;a
vast difference.
</p>

<p>
"Which of them do you really love?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no doubt in my mind, Mrs. Brack,"
he told her with earnestness.  "I was attracted by
Rose Mont's face and by her qualities of mind.  I
thought I loved her.  Possibly, had I married her,
I never should have known that I had mistaken
admiration for love.
</p>

<p>
"But Ruth I have married.  And from the moment
I knew she was mine&mdash;yes, from the moment
we clasped hands upon the wharf&mdash;my feeling for
her was far different from that I had held for
Rose.
</p>

<p>
"Rose has no power over me, Mrs. Brack.  I
cannot explain it very clearly; but it is true.  There
is no response in me when I touch her hand or
when she is near me.  But Ruth&mdash;I tell you I love
my wife, Mrs. Brack, and I'll fight for the possession
of her if any man tries to take her from me!"
</p>

<p>
"That is enough!  I believe you!" the woman
said, her eyes shining.  "You need comfort as well
as Ruth, for you, too, have suffered.  And I am
going to tell you something, that which will bring
to your heart the assurance it needs.
</p>

<p>
"Your wife has been a poor girl all her life.  Of
late she has been a nurse, supporting herself
entirely.  She was tacitly adopted into the family of
this John B. White when she was very small.
</p>

<p>
"Afterward the family suffered reverses and came
to America, bringing Ruth with them.  When the
elder White died, this son was taken by an uncle
and aunt to Europe to finish his education there.
But Ruth was old enough when they separated for
them to have felt some attachment.
</p>

<p>
"They corresponded.  For two years now his
letters have been loverlike.  He had studied to be
an artist and had gained some celebrity in Italy.
The less the girl encouraged him the more eager
he was to come to America and prove to her that
she still loved him&mdash;as he claimed to love her.  It
was born of the man's romantic nature, I presume;
yet he, poor fellow, has lost everything in this affair.
Ruth agreed finally to marry him if, upon his
appearance, she should be assured he was a man she
could learn to love.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you may well blush, Mr. Ryder," pursued
Mrs. Brack, smiling.  "She discovered instantly&mdash;in
the flash of an eye&mdash;that she could love you.  She
did love you.  She does love you.  She declares
vehemently if White had met her she would have
run away from him.
</p>

<p>
"After their terrible scene the other day&mdash;did you
know about that?"  Ryder nodded.  "She came to
you for an explanation&mdash;for help.  You are still a
young man, John Ryder.  You do not understand
women.  You left her alone&mdash;when she needed
you&mdash;and without a word to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
"White might have been foolish enough to linger
about and cause more trouble, but Miss Solomons,
who overheard his talk with your wife, tells me
she 'chased him.'  That girl is dreadfully slangy
and appears to be hard and unfeminine; but she
has a soft heart under it all, Mr. Ryder."
</p>

<p>
"I can well believe it," agreed Ryder, thinking of
"Little Laurel's Lovers."
</p>

<p>
"I met your wife in the corridor ready dressed
to leave the hotel," pursued Mrs. Brack.  "She had
packed her trunks and would have been foolish
enough to run away.
</p>

<p>
"It was by chance&mdash;no, it was providential&mdash;that
I spoke to her.  And because I am an old woman
and have lived my life and have both suffered and
been happy, she told me all.  I saw that Mrs. Judson
would succeed in making her scandalous story
(that I had already heard and then understood)
sound true if we were not careful.  She has even
been saying that you ran away from your
bride&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Confound her!" ejaculated John Ryder.  "And
after all Ruth's kindness to her!"
</p>

<p>
"She is confounded&mdash;and by her own evil tongue.
All gossips are in the end," said Mrs. Brack.  "My
husband and I have been in this hotel fourteen
years.  If <i>I</i> approve of a person the guests at large
are not very likely to believe the scandalous stories
of such flutterbudgets as Mrs. Judson.
</p>

<p>
"I have made Ruth appear with us in the dining-room.
That put a stop to all the gossip.  And
so&mdash;she is waiting for you in her rooms now,
Mr. Ryder.  She is a girl that any man&mdash;I do not
care how high he may be&mdash;should be proud to
secure for a wife, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am going to her!" cried John Ryder, and
darted away.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
About a week later, one evening, as John Ryder
and his wife were going up from dinner, the clerk
handed him a letter.  The envelope was creamy and
very thick, and the writing, angular and firm,
betrayed the feminine hand.
</p>

<p>
"This is from Miss Mont," he said to his wife,
and when they reached their suite she sat eagerly
upon the arm of the big chair while he opened the
envelope.
</p>

<p>
Together they looked over the letter that threw
light on important facts which correspondence on
both sides had brought to view.  In one place Rose
Mont wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"From what your wife writes me about her
remembrance of her early years and from my own
memory, I am confident that she is the sister Ruth
whom I so dearly loved when our parents died and
we children were scattered.  I remember I almost
cried my eyes out for her, although for the boys and
for our older sister, Gertrude, I did not greatly care.
</p>

<p>
"And that we should grow up to look so much
alike!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Again she wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Your invitation, seconded by dear Ruth, is
appreciated; but I must refuse it now.  I could not
come to disturb your new-made happiness.  Besides,
Mr. Marks has contracted for a seven-week engagement
in Chicago and we start for the West
to-morrow.  When I return to New York in the spring
or early summer we will have recovered our
equilibrium, I fancy, and we all, as brother and sisters,
may meet with more freedom.  Until we meet, God
bless you!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your sister,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ROSE MONT."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sorry she's taken up that stage
business," Ryder said with a sigh.  "And yet she has
talent for it and she's a good woman.  We'll give
her the time of her life when she does come East.
We'll be in our own home then, honey."
</p>

<p>
Ruth was looking at him very closely, but he was
quite unconscious of the meaning of this scrutiny.
Suddenly she seized him around the neck and
hugged him tightly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she murmured, "I won't be jealous of
my own sister."
</p>

<p>
Ryder did not hear.  But he held her away from
him for a moment and looked into her eyes.
"Where's that chain and locket you used to wear?"
he suddenly demanded.
</p>

<p>
A vivid blush flooded into her throat and cheeks.
"That&mdash;that's put away.  Johnny White gave it to
me when I was a little girl.  It&mdash;it had a lock of his
hair in it I thought it was <i>your</i> hair, dearest.
How silly of me!"
</p>

<p>
Ryder smiled grimly.  "And you used to kiss it,
I'll be bound, thinking it was mine?"
</p>

<p>
"How did you know?" she demanded, starting up
rather petulantly.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  I know a lot of things now&mdash;since I've
been married.  By thunder!  Marriage <i>does</i> open
a man's eyes."
</p>

<p>
And then he laughed and drew her down against
his breast again, and they were silent for a long
while.
</p>
